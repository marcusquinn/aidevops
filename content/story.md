# Story Design & Narrative Frameworks

**Purpose**: Transform research insights into compelling narratives using proven storytelling frameworks, hook formulas, and angle selection strategies.

**Position in pipeline**: Research → **Story** → Production → Distribution

**Key principle**: "Proven first, original second" — start with validated patterns, add 3% twist for differentiation.

---

## Hook Formulas

The first 3 seconds determine 80% of content performance. Use these 7 hook types with 6-12 word constraint:

### 1. Bold Claim Hook

**Pattern**: Make an extreme, specific claim that challenges conventional wisdom.

**Examples**:
- "95% of AI influencers fail within 90 days"
- "This $7 tool replaced my $50K video team"
- "I made $100K using only free AI tools"

**When to use**: High-confidence claims backed by data or personal results.

### 2. Question Hook

**Pattern**: Ask a question that exposes a pain point or desire.

**Examples**:
- "Why do your AI videos look so fake?"
- "What if you could 10x content output tomorrow?"
- "Are you making these 3 fatal AI mistakes?"

**When to use**: When audience already aware of problem, needs solution validation.

### 3. Story Hook

**Pattern**: Drop into the middle of a compelling narrative moment.

**Examples**:
- "I lost $10K before learning this one thing"
- "My client fired me, then hired me back"
- "Day 1 vs Day 100 of AI content creation"

**When to use**: Transformation stories, case studies, personal journey content.

### 4. Contrarian Hook

**Pattern**: Challenge popular advice or common practices.

**Examples**:
- "Stop using ChatGPT for content creation"
- "Why I deleted all my AI-generated videos"
- "The AI tool everyone recommends is wrong"

**When to use**: Differentiation from competitors, pattern interrupt in saturated niches.

### 5. Result Hook

**Pattern**: Lead with the outcome, create curiosity about the method.

**Examples**:
- "1M views in 30 days with zero followers"
- "How I automated 40 hours of work weekly"
- "From $0 to $10K MRR using only AI"

**When to use**: Aspirational content, case studies, method reveals.

### 6. Problem-Agitate Hook

**Pattern**: State problem, amplify the pain, hint at solution.

**Examples**:
- "Your AI content is getting ignored. Here's why."
- "Spending 10 hours per video? You're doing it wrong."
- "AI tools are expensive. Until you find these."

**When to use**: Solution-focused content, tool comparisons, method tutorials.

### 7. Curiosity Gap Hook

**Pattern**: Create information gap that demands resolution.

**Examples**:
- "The AI secret nobody talks about"
- "What Sora 2 users don't want you to know"
- "I found the AI content cheat code"

**When to use**: Insider knowledge, advanced techniques, competitive intel.

## 4-Part Script Framework

Every piece of content should contain these 4 elements in sequence:

### Part 1: Hook (First 3 Seconds)

- Use one of the 7 hook formulas above
- Visual must match hook (show the result, problem, or transformation)
- No intro, no "hey guys", no channel branding — hook FIRST
- Pattern interrupt: contrast, extremes, unexpected combinations

**Visual cues for hooks**:
- Bold text overlay with key claim
- Before/after split screen
- Shocking statistic or result
- Face with strong emotion (surprise, frustration, excitement)

### Part 2: Storytelling (Middle 60-80%)

Use one of these narrative structures:

#### Before/During/After Transformation Arc

- **Before**: Paint the pain state (specific, relatable)
- **During**: Show the turning point or method discovery
- **After**: Demonstrate the transformation with proof

**Example**: "I was spending 40 hours/week on content (Before). Then I discovered this AI pipeline (During). Now I produce 10x output in 4 hours (After)."

#### Problem-Solution-Result

- **Problem**: Specific pain point with emotional weight
- **Solution**: Your method/tool/framework (the "how")
- **Result**: Measurable outcome with social proof

**Example**: "AI videos look fake (Problem). Use this 2-step post-processing workflow (Solution). Now my content gets 3x engagement (Result)."

#### Listicle with Stakes

- Frame as "X things that [achieve desire] or [avoid pain]"
- Each item builds on previous (escalating value)
- Final item is the "secret" or highest-leverage insight

**Example**: "5 AI tools that replaced my $50K team: #5 saves 2 hours, #4 saves 5 hours, #3 saves 10 hours, #2 saves 20 hours, #1 is the game-changer..."

#### Hero's Journey (Long-Form)

- **Ordinary World**: Relatable starting point
- **Call to Adventure**: Problem or opportunity appears
- **Trials**: Obstacles, failed attempts, learning
- **Transformation**: Breakthrough moment
- **Return**: Share the knowledge, help others

**When to use**: YouTube long-form, blog posts, case studies, personal brand content.

### Part 3: Soft Sell (Last 10-20%)

- Transition from value to offer (if monetizing)
- "If you want [specific result], I've created [resource]"
- No hard pitch — position as natural next step
- For non-monetized content: CTA to subscribe, comment, or next video

**Monetization routing** (from t199.8 notes):
1. **Affiliates first**: Market research content with affiliate links
2. **Info products**: $5-27 offers for cold traffic (guides, templates, mini-courses)
3. **Upsell**: Higher-ticket coaching, done-for-you, community access
4. **Q4 seasonality**: Buying intent peaks Oct-Dec

### Part 4: Visual Cues (Throughout)

- **Text overlays**: Key points, statistics, transitions
- **B-roll**: Illustrate concepts (screen recordings, stock footage, AI-generated scenes)
- **Pacing**: 1-3 second cuts for short-form, 4-10 seconds for long-form
- **Music/SFX**: Emotional cues aligned with narrative beats

---

## Campaign Audit Process

Before launching content, run this 7-step audit:

### 1. Analyze Offer: Homework vs Value

- **Question**: Does this require effort (homework) or deliver instant value?
- **Rule**: Cold traffic wants value, warm traffic accepts homework
- **Fix**: Reframe homework as "simple 3-step process" or provide done-for-you alternative

### 2. Check Urgency

- **Question**: Why should they act NOW vs later?
- **Urgency types**: Scarcity (limited spots), time-bound (deadline), FOMO (others winning)
- **Fix**: Add deadline, limited availability, or trending/timely angle

### 3. Analyze Pain Angle

- **Question**: Are we targeting pain (avoid loss) or aspiration (gain)?
- **Rule**: Pain converts faster but smaller market; aspiration scales but needs more proof
- **Fix**: Test both angles, measure which resonates (see Optimization section)

### 4. Cosmetic vs Life-Changing

- **Question**: Is this a surface-level improvement or fundamental transformation?
- **Rule**: Life-changing commands premium pricing and loyalty; cosmetic is commoditized
- **Fix**: Reframe cosmetic as gateway to life-changing, or focus on life-changing outcome

### 5. Audit Hook + Visual First 3 Seconds

- **Question**: Does the hook + visual create pattern interrupt and curiosity?
- **Test**: Show to 5 people unfamiliar with topic — do they want to keep watching?
- **Fix**: Use hook variant generation (see Optimization), test multiple options

### 6. Implement All 4 Elements

- **Checklist**: Hook ✓ Storytelling ✓ Soft Sell ✓ Visual Cues ✓
- **Common miss**: Jumping straight to tutorial without hook or story
- **Fix**: Restructure to lead with hook, wrap tutorial in narrative

### 7. Test and Measure

- **Metrics**: CTR (thumbnail/title), retention (hook quality), conversion (offer strength)
- **Minimum**: 10 variants, 250-sample rule before judging (see content/optimization.md)
- **Fix**: Kill below 2%, scale above 2%, go aggressive above 3%

## Pain vs Aspiration Angle Selection

Choose your narrative angle based on audience awareness and market maturity:

### Pain Angle (Avoid Loss)

**When to use**:
- Audience actively experiencing problem
- Saturated market (need to stand out with urgency)
- High-ticket offers (pain justifies investment)

**Frameworks**:
- "Stop losing [time/money/opportunity] to [problem]"
- "The hidden cost of [common mistake]"
- "Why [current approach] is killing your [desired outcome]"

**Example**: "Your AI videos are costing you 10 hours per week. Here's the 2-hour alternative."

### Aspiration Angle (Gain Desire)

**When to use**:
- Audience aware of opportunity but not yet committed
- Blue ocean market (educate on possibility)
- Scalable offers (broad appeal)

**Frameworks**:
- "How to achieve [specific result] in [timeframe]"
- "The [method] that [impressive outcome]"
- "From [before state] to [after state] using [approach]"

**Example**: "How I 10x'd my content output using this AI pipeline."

### Hybrid Approach

Combine both: lead with pain (hook attention), pivot to aspiration (sell transformation).

**Example**: "Spending 40 hours/week on content? (Pain) Here's how I cut it to 4 hours while 10x-ing output (Aspiration)."

---

## Pattern Interrupt Principle

Break expectations to capture attention in saturated feeds.

### Contrast

- Before/after split screens
- Unexpected juxtapositions ("I replaced my $50K team with $7/month")
- Visual contradictions (luxury setting + budget message)

### Extremes

- Hyperbolic claims (backed by proof): "1M views in 30 days"
- Extreme specificity: "This 47-second technique"
- Extreme simplicity: "One prompt that changed everything"

### Unexpected Combinations

- Combine unrelated concepts: "AI + ancient storytelling"
- Reverse common advice: "Stop using ChatGPT"
- Niche crossover: "What poker taught me about AI content"

**Warning**: Pattern interrupt must be authentic. Clickbait without payoff destroys trust.

## Storytelling Frameworks Reference

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

- **Attention**: Hook (first 3 seconds)
- **Interest**: Problem/opportunity (why this matters)
- **Desire**: Solution/transformation (what's possible)
- **Action**: CTA (next step)

**Best for**: Short-form, ads, landing pages

### Three-Act Structure

- **Act 1**: Setup (introduce character, world, problem)
- **Act 2**: Confrontation (obstacles, rising tension, attempts)
- **Act 3**: Resolution (breakthrough, transformation, new normal)

**Best for**: Long-form YouTube, case studies, personal brand stories

### Hero's Journey (Expanded)

See "Part 2: Storytelling" section above for full breakdown.

**Best for**: Origin stories, transformation content, building personal brand authority

### Problem-Solution-Result

See "Part 2: Storytelling" section above.

**Best for**: Tutorial content, tool reviews, method reveals

### Listicle with Stakes

See "Part 2: Storytelling" section above.

**Best for**: Compilation content, tool roundups, tip lists

## "Proven First, Original Second" Strategy

### The 3% Twist Rule

1. **Find proven content** in your niche (high views, engagement, recent)
2. **Analyze the structure**: hook type, narrative arc, visual style, pacing
3. **Replicate 97%**: Same hook formula, same story structure, same content type
4. **Differentiate 3%**: Your unique angle, updated data, personal story, better production

**Example**:
- **Proven**: "I tried 10 AI video tools so you don't have to"
- **Your 3% twist**: "I tested 10 AI video tools with the same prompt — results shocked me"
- **Differentiation**: Controlled experiment (same prompt), specific outcome (shocked), implies data-driven comparison

### Why This Works

- **Proven patterns** = validated demand, known conversion
- **3% twist** = enough differentiation to avoid being a clone
- **Faster iteration** = skip the "will this work?" phase, focus on execution

### How to Find Proven Content

1. **Platform search**: Top results for your target keywords
2. **Competitor analysis**: What's working for similar creators (see content/research.md)
3. **Cross-platform signals**: TikTok → YouTube Shorts, Twitter threads → LinkedIn articles
4. **Trend tools**: Google Trends, TikTok Creative Center, YouTube trending

---

## Integration with Content Pipeline

### Input from Research (content/research.md)

- Audience pain points (exact language from Reddit/forums)
- Competitor content gaps (what's missing in top content)
- Niche viability signals (demand + buying intent + low competition)
- Creator brain clone insights (what angles work for top performers)

### Output to Production

- **Writing** (content/production/writing.md): Script structure, scene breakdown, copy
- **Image** (content/production/image.md): Thumbnail concepts, visual style, key frames
- **Video** (content/production/video.md): Shot list, B-roll directions, pacing notes
- **Audio** (content/production/audio.md): Voiceover tone, emotional cues, music selection
- **Characters** (content/production/characters.md): Persona selection, speaking style, visual identity

### Feedback from Optimization (content/optimization.md)

- Hook variant testing results (which formulas convert)
- Retention analysis (where story loses audience)
- A/B testing insights (pain vs aspiration performance)

## Examples in Practice

### Example 1: YouTube Long-Form (10-15 min)

**Research input**: "AI video tools" niche, audience pain = "tools are expensive and complicated"

**Story design**:
- **Hook**: Result hook — "I made 100 videos in 30 days spending $0"
- **Structure**: Problem-Solution-Result
  - Problem: AI video tools cost $50-200/month, steep learning curve
  - Solution: Free tool stack + simple 3-step workflow
  - Result: 100 videos, $0 spent, 500K views
- **Angle**: Aspiration (gain) — "achieve more with less"
- **Twist**: Free tools + specific workflow (vs generic "best tools" list)

**Output to production**:
- Script: 10-minute breakdown, 4 chapters (hook, problem, solution, results)
- Visuals: Screen recordings of each tool, before/after examples, results dashboard
- Tone: Enthusiastic but authentic, "I'm sharing what worked for me"

### Example 2: TikTok/Shorts (60 sec)

**Research input**: "AI influencer" niche, audience pain = "my AI content looks fake"

**Story design**:
- **Hook**: Problem-Agitate — "Your AI videos look fake. Here's why."
- **Structure**: Listicle with Stakes — "3 mistakes making your AI content obvious"
- **Angle**: Pain (avoid) — "stop getting ignored"
- **Twist**: Specific technical fixes (vs vague "make it better" advice)

**Output to production**:
- Script: 3 mistakes (15 sec each), 1 solution per mistake, fast pacing
- Visuals: Side-by-side (fake vs fixed), text overlays for each mistake
- Tone: Direct, no fluff, "here's the fix"

### Example 3: Blog Post (SEO-focused)

**Research input**: "Sora 2 prompts" keyword, audience = beginners seeking templates

**Story design**:
- **Hook**: Curiosity Gap — "The Sora 2 prompt template that gets cinematic results"
- **Structure**: Problem-Solution-Result + Tutorial
  - Problem: Generic prompts = generic output
  - Solution: 6-section master template (from t199.5 notes)
  - Result: Cinematic quality, consistent style
- **Angle**: Aspiration (gain) — "create pro-level videos"
- **Twist**: Structured template with examples (vs scattered tips)

**Output to production**:
- Writing: SEO-optimized structure, H2/H3 hierarchy, template as downloadable
- Visuals: Example outputs, annotated template, comparison shots
- Tone: Educational, step-by-step, "you can do this"

---

## Advanced: Multi-Angle Testing

For high-leverage content, create multiple story angles from the same research:

**Research**: "AI video generation" niche, audience = content creators

**Angle 1 (Pain)**: "Stop wasting 10 hours per video"
- Hook: Problem-Agitate
- Story: Before/During/After (time savings)
- CTA: "Get the workflow"

**Angle 2 (Aspiration)**: "How I 10x'd my content output"
- Hook: Result
- Story: Problem-Solution-Result (output multiplier)
- CTA: "Learn the system"

**Angle 3 (Contrarian)**: "Why I stopped using [popular tool]"
- Hook: Contrarian
- Story: Hero's Journey (discovery of better method)
- CTA: "See the alternative"

**Test all 3**, measure performance (see content/optimization.md), double down on winner.
