# AI DevOps Framework

**Unleash your AI assistant's true potential with specialist DevOps agents — designed to manage your all your infrastructure and services with security and reliability guidance on every decision.**

*"List all my servers and websites, and check each for theme and plugin update needs, SEO and page loading performance scores, and give me a list of recommended priorities"* - **One conversation, complete infrastructure management.**

## **Why This Framework?**

**Beyond Single-Repo Limitations:** VS Code and Web UIs work on one repo at a time. CLI AI assistants can manage your entire infrastructure when given the right tools, access, and guidance.

**DevOps Superpowers for AI:**

- **Multi-Service Management**: 30+ APIs (hosting, Git, security, monitoring, deployment)
- **Real-Time Operations**: SSH, domain management, database operations
- **Cross-Service Intelligence**: Connect patterns across your entire ecosystem
- **Unlimited Scope**: Full access to your development infrastructure for bug fixes and feature development

## **Enterprise-Grade Quality & Security**

**Comprehensive DevOps framework with tried & tested services integrations, popular and trusted MCP servers, and enterprise-grade infrastructure quality assurance code monitoring and recommendations.**

## **Security Notice**

**This framework provides agentic AI assistants with powerful infrastructure access. Use responsibly.**

**Capabilities:** Execute commands, access credentials, modify infrastructure, interact with APIs
**Your responsibility:** Use trusted AI providers, rotate credentials regularly, monitor activity

## **Quick Start**

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
mkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/marcusquinn/aidevops.git

bash .agent/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh chrome-devtools
```

## **AI Agents & Subagents**

**Agents are specialized AI personas with focused knowledge and tool access.** Instead of giving your AI assistant access to everything at once (which wastes context tokens), agents provide targeted capabilities for specific tasks.

Call them in your AI assistant conversation with a simple @mention

### **How Agents Work**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main Agent** | Domain-focused assistant (e.g., WordPress, SEO, DevOps) |
| **Subagent** | Specialized assistant for specific services (invoked with @mention) |
| **MCP Tools** | Only loaded when relevant agent is invoked (saves tokens) |

### **Main Agents**

Ordered as they appear in OpenCode Tab selector and other AI assistants:

| Name | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Plan+ | `plan-plus.md` | Read-only planning with semantic codebase search |
| Build+ | `build-plus.md` | Enhanced Build with context tools (Augment, Context7) |
| Accounting | `accounting.md` | Financial operations (QuickFile integration) |
| AI-DevOps | `aidevops.md` | Framework operations, meta-agents, setup |
| Content | `content.md` | Content creation workflows |
| Health | `health.md` | Health and wellness guidance |
| Legal | `legal.md` | Legal compliance and documentation |
| Marketing | `marketing.md` | Marketing strategy and automation |
| Research | `research.md` | Research and analysis tasks |
| Sales | `sales.md` | Sales operations and CRM |
| SEO | `seo.md` | SEO optimization, Search Console, keyword research |
| WordPress | `wordpress.md` | WordPress ecosystem (dev, admin, MainWP, LocalWP) |

### **Example Subagents with MCP Integration**

These are examples of subagents that have supporting MCPs enabled. See `.agent/` for the full list of 80+ subagents organized by domain.

| Agent | Purpose | MCPs Enabled |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `@hostinger` | Hosting, WordPress, DNS, domains | hostinger-api |
| `@hetzner` | Cloud servers, firewalls, volumes | hetzner-* (multi-account) |
| `@wordpress` | Local dev, MainWP management | localwp, context7 |
| `@seo` | Search Console, keyword research | gsc, ahrefs |
| `@code-quality` | Quality scanning, security, learning loop | context7 |
| `@browser-automation` | Testing, scraping, DevTools | chrome-devtools, context7 |
| `@git-platforms` | GitHub, GitLab, Gitea | gh_grep, context7 |
| `@agent-review` | Session analysis, agent improvement | (read/write only) |

### **Setup for OpenCode**

```bash
# Install aidevops agents for OpenCode
.agent/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh

# Check status
.agent/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh  # Shows status after generation
```

### **Setup for Other AI Assistants**

Add to your AI assistant's system prompt:

```text
Before any DevOps operations, read ~/git/aidevops/AGENTS.md for authoritative guidance.

When working with specific services, read the corresponding .agent/[service].md file
for focused guidance. Available services: hostinger, hetzner, wordpress, seo,
code-quality, browser-automation, git-platforms.
```

### **Continuous Improvement with @agent-review**

**End every session by calling `@agent-review`** to analyze what worked and what didn't:

```text
@agent-review analyze this session and suggest improvements to the agents used
```

The review agent will:
1. Identify which agents were used
2. Evaluate missing, incorrect, or excessive information
3. Suggest specific improvements to agent files
4. Generate ready-to-apply edits
5. **Optionally compose a PR** to contribute improvements back to aidevops

**This creates a feedback loop:**

```text
Session → @agent-review → Improvements → Better Agents → Better Sessions
                ↓
         PR to aidevops repo (optional)
```

**Contributing improvements:**

```text
@agent-review create a PR for improvement #2
```

The agent will create a branch, apply changes, and submit a PR to `marcusquinn/aidevops` with a structured description. Your real-world usage helps improve the framework for everyone.

**Code quality learning loop:**

The `@code-quality` agent also learns from issues. After fixing violations from SonarCloud, Codacy, ShellCheck, etc., it analyzes patterns and updates framework guidance to prevent recurrence:

```text
Quality Issue → Fix Applied → Pattern Identified → Framework Updated → Issue Prevented
```

### **Creating Custom Agents**

Create a markdown file in `~/.config/opencode/agent/` (OpenCode) or reference in your AI's system prompt:

```markdown
---
description: Short description of what this agent does
mode: subagent
temperature: 0.2
tools:
  bash: true
  specific-mcp_*: true
---

# Agent Name

Detailed instructions for the agent...
```

See `.agent/opencode-integration.md` for complete documentation.
