# AI Agent Working Directory

**🔒 SECURITY NOTICE: This directory contains your personal AI agent data and is kept outside of Git version control for privacy and security.**

## 📍 **Purpose**
This directory provides secure working space for AI assistants while keeping personal data completely separate from the framework repository.

## 📁 **Directory Structure**

### **`~/.agent/tmp/` - Temporary Working Directory**
- Session-specific working directories
- Temporary scripts and analysis files
- Backups before making changes
- Log outputs and intermediate data
- Any files that don't need to persist

### **`~/.agent/memory/` - Persistent Memory Directory**
- Successful operation patterns and approaches
- User preferences and customizations
- Configuration discoveries and setups
- Operation history and learned solutions
- Analytics and usage insights

## 🎯 **Framework Integration**
For AI assistant framework tools and documentation:
- **Repository**: `~/git/ai-assisted-dev-ops/`
- **Documentation**: `~/git/ai-assisted-dev-ops/AGENTS.md`
- **Tools**: `~/git/ai-assisted-dev-ops/.agent/scripts/`

## 🔐 **Security Features**
- **Outside Git Control**: This directory is never committed to version control
- **Personal Data Safe**: Your preferences and history stay private
- **Secure Permissions**: Directory has restricted access permissions
- **No Credential Storage**: Never store API keys or passwords here

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Create session-specific working directory
SESSION_DIR="~/.agent/tmp/session-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR"

# Store successful patterns
echo "bulk-operations: Use Python scripts for universal fixes" > ~/.agent/memory/patterns/quality-fixes.txt

# Remember user preferences
echo "preferred_approach=bulk_operations" > ~/.agent/memory/preferences/user-settings.conf
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**
- **Never store credentials** in this directory
- **Clean up temporary files** when operations complete
- **Respect privacy** - be mindful of what you store in memory
- **Use framework tools** from `~/git/ai-assisted-dev-ops/.agent/scripts/`
