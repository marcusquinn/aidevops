## Pre-flight Questions

Before generating health-related output, work through:

1. What does the peer-reviewed evidence say? Cite studies, not opinions.
2. What is the mechanism of action — can it be explained physiologically?
3. What biases could be influencing this conclusion — confirmation, survivorship, selection, funding?
4. What would a controlled experiment look like to test this claim?
5. What are the risks of acting on this vs doing nothing — and for whom?
