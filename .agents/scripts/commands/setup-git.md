# /setup-git — Guided Per-Repo Platform Secret Setup

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Command**: `/setup-git`
- **Aggregator**: `~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh`
- **Detector**: `~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/security-posture-helper.sh` (Phase 7)
- **Platform matrix**: `reference/sync-pat-platforms.md`
- **Sister command**: `/onboarding` — per-account auth (different scope)

## Scope

`/setup-git` is **per-repo platform secret setup** — most importantly `SYNC_PAT`, the
fine-grained PAT that allows the `issue-sync` workflow to author issues as the
maintainer instead of as `github-actions[bot]`. Without `SYNC_PAT`, every synced
issue carries `author_association: NONE` and the t2449 worker-briefed auto-merge
gate refuses to merge worker PRs.

**Use `/setup-git` when**:

- The toast shows `[WARN] N repos need SYNC_PAT setup`
- The toast shows `[WARN] N repos need workflow re-sync` (cross-account secrets:inherit)
- A worker PR sits BLOCKED with all-green CI
- You just registered a new repo via `aidevops init` or hand-edited `repos.json`
- You're onboarding a new operator and want every active repo's secrets right

**Use `/onboarding` instead when**:

- You need per-account auth (`gh auth login`, `glab auth login`, `tea login`)
- You need API keys for AI services (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) in `~/.config/aidevops/credentials.sh`
- You're setting up a new machine and don't yet have any repos cloned

## Security Posture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This command **never** accepts secret values in conversation. The fix path is
always `gh secret set NAME --repo SLUG` run **interactively in a separate
terminal** so the value never lands in the AI session transcript or shell
history (the `gh secret set` interactive prompt also avoids `--body "$VALUE"`,
which would leave the token in process listings).

The agent's job is: read the debt summary → tell the operator which URL to open →
confirm with `setup-debt-helper.sh verify-secret` once they're done. **No tool call ever has
a secret value as an argument.**

If the operator pastes a token into the conversation, refuse it explicitly,
discard the message context, and ask them to reset the conversation if any AI
in the loop has training-data risk. (For Claude Code / OpenCode this risk is
minimal but the discipline still applies.)

## Agent Workflow

When invoked, walk the operator through these phases. Skip phases that are
already clean (no debt → fast path to "all set").

### Phase 1 — Inventory

Run the aggregator and present the result:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh summary --format=human
```

Then list both debt classes:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh list-sync-pat-missing
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh list-cross-account-inherit
```

For each slug, also fetch the platform from `~/.config/aidevops/repos.json`
so you can route to the correct PAT URL template:

```bash
jq -r --arg slug "$SLUG" '.initialized_repos[] | select(.slug == $slug) | .platform // "github"' ~/.config/aidevops/repos.json
```

If `setup-debt-helper.sh summary` returns empty, congratulate the operator
and exit — there is nothing to do.

### Phase 1.5 — Cross-Account secrets:inherit Remediation (t2880)

For each repo returned by `list-cross-account-inherit`, present this template:

```text
=== Repo: <SLUG> — workflow re-sync needed ===

Why this matters: your .github/workflows/issue-sync.yml was installed before
#20976 fixed the canonical caller template. It uses `secrets: inherit` instead
of an explicit SYNC_PAT mapping. GitHub only propagates secrets:inherit within
the same org/enterprise — callers from a different account receive no secrets,
so issue-sync silently fails.

Fix (one command — run in a separate terminal):

  aidevops sync-workflows --apply --repo <SLUG>

This replaces the secrets:inherit line in issue-sync.yml with the explicit
mapping from the updated template and opens a PR in <SLUG> to apply the change.

After the PR merges, verify:

  aidevops check-workflows --repo <SLUG>

The workflow should be classified as CURRENT/CALLER with no drift.

Dismiss without re-syncing (e.g., intentional fork with own secrets):
  aidevops security dismiss cross-account-inherit-<SLUG_SAFE>
```

After the operator confirms the re-sync PR is merged, move on.

### Phase 2 — Per-Repo Walkthrough

For each repo with missing `SYNC_PAT`, present this template (substitute slug
and platform). Read the platform-specific section from
`reference/sync-pat-platforms.md` and emit the URL with required scopes
pre-encoded.

#### GitHub example

```text
=== Repo: <SLUG> (platform: github) ===

Why this matters: without SYNC_PAT on this repo, issues created by
issue-sync.yml are authored by github-actions[bot] (author_association NONE),
which causes the t2449 worker-briefed auto-merge gate to refuse to merge
worker PRs. Setting SYNC_PAT once unblocks every future worker PR on this
repo.

Step 1 — Create a fine-grained PAT
   Open this URL in your browser. Scopes are pre-filled:

     https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new?name=aidevops-sync-<SLUG_SAFE>&description=aidevops%20issue-sync%20PAT%20for%20<SLUG_URLENC>&expiration=90&target_name=<OWNER>&permissions=contents:write,issues:write,pull_requests:write,metadata:read

   Set repository access to "Only select repositories → <SLUG>".
   Click Generate. Save the generated token.

Step 2 — Save to your password manager NOW
   GitHub will not show this token again. Add an entry like:

     Title:    aidevops SYNC_PAT — <SLUG>
     URL:      https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
     Expiry:   <90 days from today>
     Notes:    Fine-grained PAT, scoped to <SLUG> only.
               Used by .github/workflows/issue-sync.yml.

Step 3 — Set the repo secret (SEPARATE TERMINAL)
   In a new terminal window — NOT this AI session — run:

     gh secret set SYNC_PAT --repo <SLUG>

   The CLI will prompt for the value. Paste the token there. This keeps the
   token out of this conversation transcript and out of shell history.

Step 4 — Confirm setup landed
   Type: verify <SLUG>

   I will run setup-debt-helper.sh verify-secret which checks `gh secret list`
   for SYNC_PAT presence — it never reads the value.
```

#### Other platforms

GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket: read the appropriate section of
`reference/sync-pat-platforms.md`. If a platform is listed as "stub" in the
matrix, emit a clear "manual setup required, see `<docs URL>`" message and move
to the next repo.

### Phase 3 — Verification

When the operator types `verify <SLUG>` (or `verify all`):

```bash
# Per-repo
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh verify-secret <SLUG> SYNC_PAT

# All known
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh list-sync-pat-missing | \
    while IFS= read -r slug; do
        ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/setup-debt-helper.sh verify-secret "$slug" SYNC_PAT
    done
```

Report each result. On confirmed-set repos, the next pulse cycle's
`security-posture-helper.sh` run will detect SYNC_PAT and remove the advisory
file automatically — no manual dismiss step needed.

If the operator wants to dismiss without setting (e.g., they've decided this
repo doesn't need worker auto-merge):

```bash
aidevops security dismiss sync-pat-<SLUG_SAFE>
```

### Phase 4 — Wrap

After all advisories are addressed, summarise:

- Number of repos walked
- Number now set vs dismissed vs deferred
- Reminder to verify expiry calendar entries are saved in their password manager
- Pointer to the next pulse cycle re-running `aidevops security check` (no manual rerun needed)

## Out of scope (Phase 1)

These belong in follow-up tasks; do not attempt them in `/setup-git`:

- Repo discovery / auto-registration of unregistered `~/Git/*` directories — Phase 2
- Multi-platform full implementation (GitLab/Gitea/Bitbucket guided flow) — Phase 2
- AI review keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODERABBIT_API_KEY` per-repo) — Phase 3
- `gh auth` scope checks, default-branch drift, workflow-file drift — separate `aidevops security check` covers these
- Writing a manifest of confirmed-set secrets — Phase 2

If the operator asks for any of the above, point them at the relevant
follow-up issue (filed off this PR) and continue with the in-scope SYNC_PAT
walkthrough.
