# interactive-session-helper.sh - Interactive session issue-ownership primitive (t2056)
#
# Purpose: provide a mandatory, AI-driven acquire/release primitive for
# interactive GitHub issue ownership. When an interactive session engages
# with an issue, this helper applies `status:in-review` + self-assignment
# so the pulse's dispatch-dedup guard (`dispatch-dedup-helper.sh is-assigned`)
# will not dispatch a parallel worker.
#
# SCOPE LIMITATION (GH#19861):
#   `claim` blocks the pulse's DISPATCH path only. It does NOT block:
#   - The enrich path (pulse-enrich.sh) — may overwrite issue title/body/labels
#   - The completion-sweep path — may strip status labels
#   - Any other non-dispatch pulse operation that modifies label/title/body state
#   If you need protection against ALL pulse modifications (e.g., investigating
#   a pulse bug), use `lockdown` instead — it applies `no-auto-dispatch` +
#   `status:in-review` + self-assignment + conversation lock + audit comment.
#
# Why reuse status:in-review rather than a new label:
#   - `_has_active_claim` in dispatch-dedup-helper.sh already treats it as an
#     active claim that blocks dispatch.
#   - `_normalize_stale_should_skip_reset` in pulse-issue-reconcile.sh already
#     skips it during stale-recovery (only queued/in-progress get reset).
#   - `ISSUE_STATUS_LABEL_PRECEDENCE` in shared-constants.sh already ranks it
#     second after `done` for label-invariant reconciliation.
#   - `.github/workflows/issue-sync.yml` already clears it on PR-close cleanup.
# All the gating infrastructure is in place. The only gap this helper closes
# is timing: today the label lands at PR open (via `full-loop-helper.sh
# commit-and-pr`); we need it to land at interactive session engage.
#
# AI-driven contract:
#   The primary enforcement layer is a `prompts/build.txt` rule telling the
#   agent to call claim/release from conversation intent. Phase 2 (t2057)
#   adds code-level safety nets in worktree-helper.sh, claim-task-id.sh, and
#   approval-helper.sh. Users are never expected to invoke this helper by
#   hand — the slash command and CLI exist as fallbacks only.
#
# Sub-libraries (GH#21320):
#   - interactive-session-helper-stamp.sh      (stamp CRUD, claim comments)
#   - interactive-session-helper-commands.sh   (claim, lockdown, unlock, release, status, write-stamp)

#   - gemini-code-assist: redundant gh+jq calls in the claim hot path
#   - augmentcode: the prior two-call form's inner `if !` branch conflated
#     rc=1 (parent-task absent → carve-out applies) with rc=2 (gh lookup
#     failed → caller intent unknown), failing CLOSED on transient errors
#     and contradicting the outer fail-OPEN comment.
#
# Returns:
#   0  carve-out applies — has `auto-dispatch` AND lacks `parent-task`. Caller
#      MUST refuse to claim; self-assign would create a permanent dispatch
#      block per the t1996/t2218 invariant (see _has_active_claim in
#      dispatch-dedup-helper.sh).
#   1  carve-out does NOT apply — auto-dispatch absent OR parent-task present.
#      Caller proceeds with the normal claim path.
#   2  lookup failed (gh offline, network, auth). Caller falls through and
#      proceeds with the claim — fail-OPEN. A spurious carve-out skip on a
#      transient error would be just as harmful as a missed carve-out;
#      proceeding matches the offline gate at the top of `_isc_cmd_claim`.
#
# `if [[ $implementing -eq 0 ]] && _isc_carve_out_required ...; then` is the
# canonical caller form — only enters the skip branch on rc=0; rc=1 and rc=2
# both fall through. The `&&` short-circuit also consumes any non-zero return
# through a conditional context, protecting against set -e propagation

interactive-session-helper.sh - Interactive issue-ownership primitive (t2056)

USAGE:
  interactive-session-helper.sh claim <issue> <slug> [--worktree PATH] [--implementing]
      Apply status:in-review + self-assign + write crash-recovery stamp.
      Idempotent. Offline gh → warn-and-continue (exit 0).
      Auto-dispatch carve-out (GH#20946): refuses to claim issues tagged
      'auto-dispatch' unless --implementing is passed or the issue is also
      tagged 'parent-task'. Without the carve-out, claim creates a
      permanent dispatch block (t1996/GH#18352). Use --implementing when
      you intend to implement the issue yourself instead of letting a
      worker pick it up.

  interactive-session-helper.sh release <issue> <slug> [--unassign]
      Transition status:in-review → status:available, delete stamp.
      Idempotent. --unassign also removes self from assignees.

  interactive-session-helper.sh lockdown <issue> <slug> [--worktree PATH]
      Stricter than claim: blocks ALL pulse paths, not just dispatch.
      Applies: no-auto-dispatch + status:in-review + self-assign +
      conversation lock + audit comment + crash-recovery stamp.
      Use when investigating pulse bugs or need maximum insulation.
      Reverse with: unlock <issue> <slug>

  interactive-session-helper.sh unlock <issue> <slug> [--unassign]
      Reverse a lockdown: remove no-auto-dispatch, transition to
      status:available, unlock conversation, delete stamp, post audit.
      --unassign also removes self from assignees.

  interactive-session-helper.sh status [<issue>]
      List active claims from the stamp directory, or check one issue.

  interactive-session-helper.sh scan-stale [--auto-release | --no-auto-release]
      Three-phase stale detection:
      Phase 1  — Identify stamps with dead PID AND missing worktree path.
                 Auto-releases when BOTH conditions hold (t2414). Default: ON
                 when stdin+stdout are TTYs (interactive session), OFF otherwise.
                 Override: --auto-release / --no-auto-release flags, or
                 AIDEVOPS_SCAN_STALE_AUTO_RELEASE=0|1 env var.
                 Live PID or existing worktree: stamp is NEVER touched.
      Phase 1a — Identify stampless origin:interactive + self-assigned
                 issues (t2148). These block pulse dispatch forever
                 because _has_active_claim treats the label as a claim
                 regardless of stamp state. Does NOT auto-release —
                 `normalize_active_issue_assignments` auto-recovers after
                 24h; the agent can unassign immediately at session start.
      Phase 2  — Scan all pulse-enabled repos for closed-not-merged PRs
                 (last 14 days) whose linked issue is still OPEN. Surfaces
                 these as recovery candidates. Does NOT auto-reopen.

  interactive-session-helper.sh post-merge <pr_number> [<slug>]
      Auto-heal two known drift patterns after a planning PR merges (t2225).
      Call after `gh pr merge` succeeds, alongside `release <N>`.
      Heal 1 (t2219): removes false status:done on OPEN For/Ref-referenced
        issues — planning-convention refs that issue-sync.yml falsely closes.
      Heal 2 (t2218): unassigns PR author from OPEN auto-dispatch issues with
        origin:interactive + no active status label (should be pulse-dispatched).
      Both passes are idempotent, fail-open, and post audit-trail comments.
      Slug defaults to the current repo if not provided.

  interactive-session-helper.sh write-stamp <issue> <slug>
      Write a crash-recovery stamp WITHOUT performing any GitHub status
      transitions. Called by claim-task-id.sh after self-assign to atomically
      close the gap where self-assign succeeded but the full claim (status:in-
      review transition) later failed. The subsequent `claim` subcommand
      overwrites the stamp with full lifecycle info. (t2943)

  interactive-session-helper.sh branch-has-active-claim <branch> [--worktree PATH]
      Exit 0 if an active interactive-session claim exists for the branch's
      issue (stamp present, PID alive, hostname matches). Exit 1 otherwise.
      Used by worktree cleanup paths (worktree-clean-lib.sh::should_skip_cleanup,
      pulse-cleanup.sh::_worktree_owner_alive) to honour active claims without
      sourcing the helper. Same source of truth as the dispatch-dedup gate.
      (t2916/GH#21074)

  interactive-session-helper.sh help
      Print this message.

CONTRACT:
  This helper is intended to be called from interactive AI sessions, driven
  by conversation intent (see `prompts/build.txt` → "Interactive issue
  ownership"). Users should never need to invoke it directly — the agent
  claims on engage and releases on signal.

  SCOPE: `claim` blocks pulse DISPATCH only (GH#19861). It does NOT block
  enrich, completion-sweep, or other non-dispatch pulse operations. For full
  insulation from all pulse paths, use `lockdown` instead.

  Slug format: owner/repo (e.g., marcusquinn/aidevops).
