# pulse-triage.sh — Triage dedup + consolidation orchestrator.
#
# Originally extracted from pulse-wrapper.sh in Phase 8 (parent: GH#18356,
# plan: todo/plans/pulse-wrapper-decomposition.md §6).
#
# Split into sub-libraries (GH#21146 / GH#21326) to comply with the 1500-line
# file-size-debt threshold. Sub-libraries:
#   - pulse-triage-cache.sh      — content-hash dedup cache, bot-skip, idempotent comment
#   - pulse-triage-evaluation.sh — consolidation/simplification label re-evaluation
#   - pulse-triage-dispatch.sh   — consolidation dispatch, locking, child issue creation
#
# This orchestrator retains:
#   - Module-level defaults
#   - _issue_needs_consolidation (>100 lines — identity key preserved)
#   - _dispatch_issue_consolidation (>100 lines — identity key preserved)
#   - Source calls to the three sub-libraries
#
# Must be sourced from pulse-wrapper.sh. Depends on shared-constants.sh
# and worker-lifecycle-common.sh being sourced first by the orchestrator.

# t2151: Cross-runner advisory lock TTL for consolidation dispatch. If a
# `consolidation-in-progress` label stays applied longer than this many hours
# without being naturally released (by successful child creation + release,
# or by release-on-child-close), the backfill pass clears it. Prevents a
# crashed runner from permanently wedging the parent behind a stale lock.
#
# Default 6h: long enough to absorb GitHub API outages, slow runners, and
# operator intervention windows; short enough that a truly stuck lock gets
# cleared within one working day rather than accumulating.
#
# t2151: Grace period after lock acquisition during which a re-check of
# the comment-based tiebreaker is suppressed. The tiebreaker comment is
# posted immediately after the label; a tight re-read racing against the
# caller's own comment would see its own marker plus the competitor's and
# pick a winner before either runner has flushed its child-creation API
# call. 2s is comfortably longer than the single-writer path (label + comment
# + child-create = ~0.3-0.8s in normal conditions) and short enough that
# operator latency is imperceptible.

#   See `_consolidation_lock_acquire` for the full protocol.
