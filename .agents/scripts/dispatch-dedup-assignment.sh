# Check if a GitHub issue is already assigned to another runner.
#
# This is the primary cross-machine dedup guard. Process-based checks
# (is_duplicate, has_worker_for_repo_issue) only see local processes —
# they miss workers running on other machines. The GitHub assignee is
# the single source of truth visible to all runners.
#
# Owner/maintainer assignment carries two different meanings:
#   1. passive backlog ownership / maintainer review bookkeeping
#   2. active worker claim (when paired with status:queued/in-progress)
#
# Treating all owner/maintainer assignees as active claims created a queue
# starvation bug: the pulse discovers unassigned issues by default, while
# several tooling pipelines auto-assigned newly created debt issues to the
# maintainer. The result was hundreds of open issues that looked "claimed"
# to the deterministic guard but had no worker, no queued state, and no PR.
#
# Canonical dedup rule (t1996):
#   The dispatch dedup signal is (active status label) AND (non-self assignee).
#   Both are required; neither alone is sufficient.
#   See _has_active_claim() for the label-half definition.
#   This function enforces the combined check: it first checks whether an
#   assignee is present; if so, it calls _has_active_claim() to determine
#   if the passive exemption for owner/maintainer should be bypassed.
#
# Systemic rule:
# - self_login never blocks
# - owner/maintainer assignees are passive unless EITHER:
#     (a) the issue has an active claim status label — status:queued,
#         status:in-progress, status:in-review, or status:claimed
#         (full active lifecycle, not just the worker-set states), OR
#     (b) the issue has the origin:interactive label without auto-dispatch —
#         a human session is actively driving the work regardless of status
#         label state
#         (GH#18352 — closes the race where an interactive claim used
#         status:claimed, which was not recognised as an active state,
#         so the pulse dispatched a duplicate worker mid-flight)
# - auto-dispatch is an explicit handoff signal: origin:interactive remains
#   provenance but no longer bypasses owner/maintainer passive assignment.
# - any other assignee blocks dispatch — UNLESS the assignment is stale
#   (no active worker, dispatch claim >1h old, no recent progress).
#   Stale assignments are auto-recovered (GH#15060).
#
# Every dispatch decision site that emits a worker assignment MUST route
# through this function (or apply an equivalent inline combined check)
# before claiming. Any code path that checks only labels or only assignees
# is not safe in multi-operator conditions. (t1996 — audit confirmed that
# dispatch_with_dedup, apply_dispatch_max, and all implementation
# dispatch paths correctly route through check_dispatch_dedup which calls
# this function at Layer 6; normalize_active_issue_assignments was hardened
# in the same fix to also call this before self-assigning orphaned issues.)
#
# This preserves GH#10521 (maintainer assignment alone must not starve the
# queue) while still protecting GH#11141 (owner-assigned queued work must
# block other runners once a real claim is active) and GH#18352 (interactive
# sessions working on owner-assigned issues must not be raced by the pulse).
#
# Args:
#   $1 = issue number
#   $2 = repo slug (owner/repo)
#   $3 = (optional) current runner login — if assigned to self, not a dup
# Returns:
#   exit 0 if assigned to another login (do NOT dispatch), parent-task labeled,
#          no-auto-dispatch labeled, waiting for contributor information,
#          cost-budget exceeded, or guard cannot determine safety
#          (GUARD_UNCERTAIN)
#   exit 1 if unassigned or assigned only to self (safe to dispatch)
# Outputs: one of the following signals on stdout when blocking:
#   PARENT_TASK_BLOCKED (label=<name>)      — unconditional parent-task / meta block
#   PUBLICATION_PENDING_BLOCKED (label=...) — canonical planning publication has not landed
#   NO_AUTO_DISPATCH_BLOCKED (label=...)    — unconditional no-auto-dispatch block (t2832)
#   NEEDS_INFO_BLOCKED (label=...)          — waiting for contributor information
#   INFRASTRUCTURE_BLOCKED (label=...)      — infrastructure / billing / runner advisory block
#   COST_BUDGET_EXCEEDED (...)              — token spend circuit breaker
#   GUARD_UNCERTAIN (reason=...)            — internal error, cannot determine safety
#   <assignee info>                         — active claim by another runner
#
# FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT (t2046):
#   When the guard cannot determine whether dispatch is safe due to an internal
#   error (gh API failure, jq error, helper failure), the function MUST block
#   dispatch and emit GUARD_UNCERTAIN. This is intentionally conservative:
#   a transient block clears in the next pulse cycle at zero cost; a wasted
#   worker dispatch burns ~20K tokens for zero output (GH#18458 incident).
#   The previous default (fail-open) allowed three workers to be dispatched
#   to a parent-task issue because a jq null-handling bug silently fell through
#   to the "allow dispatch" code path (see plan in todo/plans/parent-task-incident-hardening.md).

# is_assigned helper: check the no-auto-dispatch unconditional block (t2832).
#
# t2832: no-auto-dispatch label is an unconditional dispatch block. The label
# was previously honoured by enrichment, decomposition, and backfill paths but
# NOT by the dispatch path itself — workers got dispatched to issues carrying
# the label, contradicting maintainer intent and the documented behaviour.
# Closes the dispatch hole observed on GH#20827 (t2821 policy issue): six
# worker dispatches over two hours despite the label being applied at issue
# creation, all failing in the dispatch-path tautology, ~30-50K opus tokens
# burned. The label now carries the same hard-block semantics as parent-task.
#
# Use cases this enables (post-fix):
#   - Maintainer-applied "do not auto-dispatch" hold without needing #parent
#     (which forces decomposition lifecycle on focused fixes that don't decompose)
#   - interactive-session-helper.sh lockdown — already applies this label;
#     the label now actually blocks dispatch end-to-end as documented
#   - Policy-level dispatch-path tasks (t2821) — sufficient as a focused-fix
#     blocker without combining with #parent

# t3197: is_assigned helper — per-issue dispatch cooldown after launch failure.
#
# When `recover_failed_launch_state` records a `no_worker_process` failure,
# `_post_launch_cooldown_marker` (in pulse-cleanup.sh) writes an audit
# comment containing the marker:
#   <!-- dispatch-cooldown-until:<ISO8601-UTC> reason=no_worker_process runner=<login> -->
#
# This check fetches the issue's comments, authenticates an exact cooldown
# marker, and short-circuits dispatch with `DISPATCH_COOLDOWN_ACTIVE`.
# Closes the rapid-retry loop where a broken runtime burns ~5 worker
# spawns over 3-4 hours per issue with 95-99s lifespans each, repeating
# across many issues simultaneously when one runner is unhealthy.
#
# Complementary to:
#   - t2769 (per-issue 3-stack circuit breaker → status:blocked + meta-repair)
#   - t2897 (per-runner health breaker, 10 events / 6h → runner pause)
# This guard is per-issue and short (default 30 min), so it absorbs
# transient runner failures before the longer-horizon breakers fire.
#
# Gating:
#   - Skipped entirely when DISPATCH_COOLDOWN_AFTER_LAUNCH_FAILURE_SECONDS=0
#     (saves one gh API call per dispatch decision when the feature is off).
#   - A marker is accepted only from an OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR comment
#     whose nonempty authenticated `user.login` exactly matches `runner=`.
#   - The GitHub server `created_at` bounds marker lifetime: it cannot be in
#     the future, older than the configured cooldown, or claim an `until`
#     later than `created_at + cooldown`. This prevents a forged or stale
#     future timestamp from permanently poisoning dispatch.
#   - Fail-open on gh API or jq error — cooldown is an optimization, not a
#     security gate, so a flaky API call should not permanently block
#     dispatch the way GUARD_UNCERTAIN does for label/assignee checks.

#
# Labels applied by the asynchronous issue-sync workflow (issue-sync.yml)
# may not yet be present on an issue that was just created. The window
# between issue creation and the subsequent TODO.md push + workflow run
# is adversarial in multi-runner fleets: a peer runner can see an issue
# missing parent-task (not yet synced) and dispatch a worker on it.
#
# This check adds a configurable grace period (default 30s) during which
# newly created issues are skipped. It is a secondary safety net — the
# primary fix is applying labels synchronously at creation time (see
# _scan_todo_labels_for_task in claim-task-id.sh and
# _gh_wrapper_derive_todo_labels in shared-gh-wrappers.sh).
#
# Fail-open:
#   - If DISPATCH_HYDRATION_WINDOW_S=0, the check is disabled.
#   - If createdAt is absent from meta_json (pre-fetched JSON may lack it),
#     the check returns 1 (allow dispatch to continue).
