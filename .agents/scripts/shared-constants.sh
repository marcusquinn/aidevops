# =============================================================================
# GH#18950 (t2087): Bash 3.2 → bash 4+ runtime re-exec self-heal guard.
# =============================================================================
# macOS ships /bin/bash 3.2.57 which has parser and set-e propagation bugs
# (GH#18770, GH#18784, GH#18786, GH#18804, GH#18830). If this shared file
# is sourced by a script running under bash < 4 AND a modern bash is
# available at a known location, re-exec the calling script under the
# modern bash. Transparent self-heal: the script runs from the top again
# under the new interpreter, passes this guard (now on bash 4+), and
# continues normally.
#
# Guard order matters: this MUST run before any bash 4+ constructs in
# this file. It also runs AFTER the include guard to avoid re-execing
# the same script multiple times through nested sources.
#
# Chicken-and-egg avoidance:
#   - setup.sh itself does NOT source shared-constants.sh at the top; it
#     can't, because it's the thing that installs modern bash.
#   - bash-upgrade-helper.sh does NOT source shared-constants.sh either;
#     it's the detector that this guard queries.
#   - AIDEVOPS_BASH_REEXECED=1 is set before exec to prevent infinite
#     loops if a symlink points at the wrong binary.
#   - BASH_SOURCE[1] is the immediate caller; if unset, we're being
#     executed directly (e.g., `bash shared-constants.sh`) and skip
#     the guard. The guard walks the BASH_SOURCE stack to find the
#     OUTERMOST caller (the top-level script) rather than using [1],
#     so the re-exec targets the correct entry point even when sourced
#     via intermediate helpers (GH#19632 / t2176).

	# BASH_SOURCE[1] points to the intermediate, and exec-ing it would
	# replace the top-level script with a standalone run of the helper.
	# The outermost caller is the last element in the BASH_SOURCE array.

# environment of every child process. If any child is then spawned
# under /bin/bash 3.2 (e.g. an explicit `/bin/bash script.sh` call, or
# PATH mis-ordering that resolves `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to 3.2), THAT
# child's guard sees AIDEVOPS_BASH_REEXECED=1 and short-circuits the
# re-exec — leaving the grandchild running bash 3.2 and hitting any
# bash 4+ construct as a runtime error. Clearing the flag only when
# BASH_VERSINFO[0] >= 4 preserves the anti-infinite-loop property for
# the fallthrough branch (no modern bash found, still on 3.2) while
# ensuring fresh subprocess invocations get a clean guard decision.

# =============================================================================
# Credential Sanitization (t2458)
# =============================================================================
# Defense against credential-bearing text leaking into stdout/stderr/logs.
# The primary leak vector is `git remote get-url origin` when the remote URL
# embeds a token (e.g., https://gho_ABC...@github.com/owner/repo.git) — any
# helper that echoes $remote_url emits the token to the transcript, where it
# may be captured by session loggers, sent upstream to model providers, or
# surface in pasted bug reports.
#
# Two layers:
#   scrub_credentials  — strips known token prefixes (sk-, ghp_, gho_, ghs_,
#                        ghu_, github_pat_, glpat-, xoxb-, xoxp-) from any
#                        text passed to it. Pure regex, no network.
#   sanitize_url       — strips the `user:pass@` or `token@` authority from
#                        URL-shaped strings, THEN pipes through
#                        scrub_credentials to catch tokens embedded elsewhere
#                        in the URL (query params, path segments).
#
# Always prefer sanitize_url for anything derived from `git remote get-url`,
# `git config remote.*.url`, or user-supplied remote URLs. Use
# scrub_credentials for arbitrary log lines or error messages where a URL
# is not the only possible leak source.
#
# Usage:
#   echo "Remote: $(sanitize_url "$remote_url")"
#   log_error "fetch failed: $(scrub_credentials "$error_output")"

scrub_credentials() {
	local text="$1"
	# Word-boundary anchor (^|non-word-char) prevents false positives where a
	# credential prefix appears mid-word — e.g. `task-failure-handler` contains
	# the literal `sk-failure-handler` (16 chars, matches `sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}`)
	# but is NOT a credential. macOS BSD sed has no `\b`, so we capture the
	# preceding boundary character and restore it via \1 in the replacement.
	# (t2892, GH#21026)
	printf '%s' "$text" | sed -E 's/(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_-])(sk-|ghp_|gho_|ghs_|ghu_|github_pat_|glpat-|xoxb-|xoxp-)[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}/\1[redacted-credential]/g'
	return 0
}

sanitize_url() {
	local url="$1"
	local stripped
	# Strip credential authority component: scheme://user:pass@host -> scheme://host
	# Matches any scheme (http, https, git, ssh, etc.), any chars up to @.
	stripped=$(printf '%s' "$url" | sed -E 's|^([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]*://)[^@/]+@|\1|')

# =============================================================================
# Portable timeout function (macOS + Linux)
# =============================================================================
# macOS has no native `timeout` command. This function provides a portable
# wrapper that works on Linux (coreutils timeout), macOS with Homebrew
# coreutils (gtimeout), and bare macOS (background + kill fallback).
#
# Usage: timeout_sec 5 your_command arg1 arg2
# Returns: command exit code, or 124 on timeout (matches coreutils convention)
#
# Exit code mapping (POSIX: signal exits are 128 + signal number):
#   124  — timeout (GNU coreutils convention; returned by all paths below)
#   137  — killed by SIGKILL  (128 + 9)  — hard kill, process did not exit cleanly
#   143  — killed by SIGTERM  (128 + 15) — graceful termination signal
# Callers that check for timeout should test for 124. Codes 137/143 indicate
# the process was killed externally (e.g., by the OS or a concurrent pulse).
#
# NOTE: Do NOT pipe timeout_sec to head/grep — on macOS the background
# process may not be properly cleaned up when the pipe closes early.
# Instead, redirect to a temp file and process afterward.
#
# Moved here from tool-version-check.sh (PR #2909) so all scripts that
# source shared-constants.sh get portable timeout support automatically.

		#
		# GH#5530: the previous implementation used kill "$cmd_pid" which only

# Counter Safety Helper (t2763)
# =============================================================================
# safe_grep_count — count lines matching a pattern without the stacking bug.
#
# `grep -c` outputs the count to stdout AND exits 1 when there are zero
# matches. The common idiom `count=$(grep -c 'pat' file || echo "0")`
# therefore appends "0" to grep's own "0" on the zero-match path, producing
# a multi-line string "0\n0" that breaks arithmetic, comparisons, and text
# interpolation. Canonical failure: parent #20402 rendered
# "Progress: **0\n0 done**".
#
# This helper passes all arguments through to grep -c, catches its exit
# code with `|| true`, and guards the result with a regex to guarantee a
# single integer on a single line.
#
# NOTE: Designed for single-file or stdin use. With multiple file arguments,
# grep -c outputs "filename:count" per file, which fails the integer regex
# and returns 0. The -h flag is passed defensively to suppress filename
# prefixes, but multi-line output (from multiple files) still falls through
# to the 0 fallback. For multi-file counting, call once per file.
#
# Usage:
#   count=$(safe_grep_count -E '^pat' file.txt)
#   count=$(printf '%s\n' "$data" | safe_grep_count 'needle')
#   count=$(safe_grep_count 'nope' /does-not-exist)   # prints 0, no error
#
# Enforcement: `.agents/scripts/counter-stack-check.sh` flags the unsafe
# idiom in CI. See also `reference/shell-style-guide.md` § Counter Safety.

# RETURN Trap Cleanup Stack (t196)
# =============================================================================
# Prevents RETURN trap clobbering when a function needs multiple temp files.
# In bash, setting `trap '...' RETURN` twice in the same function silently
# replaces the first trap — the first temp file leaks.
#
# IMPORTANT: `trap` applies to the function that calls it, NOT the caller's
# caller. Therefore push_cleanup cannot set the trap for you — the calling
# function must set `trap '_run_cleanups' RETURN` itself.
#
# Usage pattern (replaces raw `trap 'rm ...' RETURN`):
#
#   my_func() {
#       _save_cleanup_scope
#       trap '_run_cleanups' RETURN
#       local tmp1; tmp1=$(mktemp)
#       push_cleanup "rm -f '${tmp1}'"
#       local tmp2; tmp2=$(mktemp)
#       push_cleanup "rm -f '${tmp2}'"
#       # ... both files cleaned up on return (LIFO order)
#   }
#
# Single-file shorthand (most common case — no change needed):
#
#   my_func() {
#       local tmp; tmp=$(mktemp)
#       trap 'rm -f "${tmp:-}"' RETURN
#       # ... single file, no clobbering risk
#   }
#
# Nesting: RETURN traps are function-scoped in bash 3.2+, so nested
# function calls each get their own trap. _save_cleanup_scope saves the
# parent's cleanup list; _run_cleanups restores it after executing.
#
# Migration from raw trap (only needed for multi-cleanup functions):
#   BEFORE: trap 'rm -f "${a:-}"' RETURN  # second trap clobbers first
#           trap 'rm -f "${b:-}"' RETURN
#   AFTER:  _save_cleanup_scope
#           trap '_run_cleanups' RETURN
#           push_cleanup "rm -f '${a}'"
#           push_cleanup "rm -f '${b}'"

# Clear active-lifecycle status labels on dispatch claim release (t2420).
#
# Removes only the four ACTIVE status labels (queued, claimed, in-progress,
# in-review) and optionally the worker's assignment. PRESERVES terminal
# states (done, blocked) and the eligible state (available) — those are set
# by authoritative paths (PR merge, blocker triage, explicit re-queue) and
# must survive a worker's claim release.
#
# Why not set_issue_status "" ? Because it would strip status:done set by
# the PR merge path if the CLAIM_RELEASED comment races ahead — a worker
# that succeeds, creates a PR, the PR merges (setting status:done), and
# then the worker's EXIT trap fires CLAIM_RELEASED would regress the state.
# This helper is the targeted, race-safe alternative.
#
# Why not just skip label cleanup entirely? Because without it, orphan
# labels pin an issue as "active" even though no worker holds the claim,
# blocking pulse re-dispatch via the t1996 combined-signal guard
# (active-status + assignee = block). Observed in production: #19864 and
# #19738 were both pinned status:queued/claimed for 40+ minutes after
# worker completion, with dead PIDs (one case was PID 11742 reused by
# Brave Browser — see t2421).
#
# Defensive: skips entirely if origin:interactive is present. Workers
# should never hold the claim on interactive issues (dispatch-dedup
# blocks that), but if we find one, we never touch interactive-session
# ownership state (t2056).
#
# Args:
