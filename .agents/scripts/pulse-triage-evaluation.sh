# t1982/t2144/t2151: Check whether a consolidation-task child issue currently
# "owns" this parent. Used by both _issue_needs_consolidation (as a
# pre-filter) and _dispatch_issue_consolidation (as an idempotency guard)
# so that repeat calls on the same parent do not create duplicate children.
#
# A child "owns" the parent if ANY of:
#   (a) a consolidation-task child is currently open, OR
#   (b) a consolidation-task child closed within the grace window
#       (CONSOLIDATION_RECENT_CLOSE_GRACE_MIN minutes, default 30), OR
#   (c) (t2151) the parent carries the `consolidation-in-progress` label —
#       another pulse runner is mid-way through creating a child right now.
#
# (a) and (b) cover single-runner cascades (t1982 / t2144).
# (c) covers the cross-runner race window between "about to create child"
# and "child exists on GitHub". See `_consolidation_lock_acquire` for the
# lock protocol.
#
# The grace window exists because closing the consolidation-task child
# and applying the `consolidated` label to the parent are separate steps —
# the worker closes the child first, then updates the parent. Between
# those two API calls the state is {child: closed, parent: still needs-
# consolidation, no open child}. `_backfill_stale_consolidation_labels`
# previously saw this as "no child, dispatch a new one" and re-fired,
# cascading indefinitely (observed: #19321 → #19341 + #19367 cascade on
# 2026-04-16 across two pulse runners). The grace window collapses that
# race to a single cycle.
#

# t2161: Check whether an open PR with a GitHub-native closing keyword
# referencing this parent issue is currently in-flight. Used as a safety
# net by `_issue_needs_consolidation` and `_dispatch_issue_consolidation`
# to prevent the cascade observed in GH#19448 → GH#19469 → GH#19471, where
# version drift on a contributor runner caused a stale filter to falsely
# trigger consolidation while a fix PR was already mergeable.
#
# Why this is needed AT ALL given t2144's filter fix:
#   The substantive-comment filter is the right primary defence (it solves
#   the cause: noise comments). This helper is a defence-in-depth safety
#   net that holds even when:
#     (a) a contributor runner is running pre-t2144 code,
#     (b) a future filter regression slips through,
#     (c) a new operational comment shape ships and drifts past the regex.
#   In all three cases, the existence of an in-flight PR resolving the
#   parent is a strong, runtime-checkable "the work is in progress, do
#   not file a planning task on top of it" signal.
#
# Why "in-flight PR" is a stronger signal than "open PR":
#   GitHub only auto-closes the issue when the PR MERGES, so an open PR
#   with a closing keyword has not yet resolved the issue — but the work
#   is committed, reviewable, and a consolidation child filed now would
#   become noise the moment the PR merges (the issue closes within
#   seconds of merge). Asymmetric cost: skipping consolidation when there
#   is an in-flight fix is cheap and reversible (the next pulse cycle
#   fires if the PR closes without merging); filing a duplicate child
#   issue burns a worker session and pollutes the issue thread.
#
# Closing-keyword regex sourced from `_extract_linked_issue` in
# pulse-merge.sh:1173 — matches GitHub's full close keyword list:
# close/closes/closed, fix/fixes/fixed, resolve/resolves/resolved
# (case-insensitive). Bare `#NNN` references and `For #NNN` / `Ref #NNN`
# references do NOT match — those are intentionally non-closing.
