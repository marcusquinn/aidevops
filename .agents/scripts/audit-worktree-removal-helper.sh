# audit-worktree-removal-helper.sh — Canonical audit logger for worktree-removal events (t2976).
#
# Every worktree removal event — taken or skipped — should leave exactly one structured
# log line in cleanup_worktrees.log. This helper centralises that write so callers
# never need to construct the format themselves.
#
# Usage (source this file, then call the function):
#   # shellcheck source=audit-worktree-removal-helper.sh
#   source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/audit-worktree-removal-helper.sh"
#   log_worktree_removal_event "$_WTAR_REMOVED" "worktree-helper.sh" "/path/to/wt" "branch-merged"
#
# Event types (use the constants below to avoid repeated literal violations):
#   _WTAR_REMOVED          "removed"        — worktree was actually removed
#   _WTAR_SKIPPED          "skipped"        — removal was blocked
#   _WTAR_FIXTURE_REMOVED  "fixture-removed" — removed during test teardown
#
# Reason values (non-exhaustive — free-form, kept short):
#   branch-merged     — PR/branch has merged; worktree no longer needed
#   age-eligible      — orphan exceeded age threshold (crashed/abandoned worker)
#   manual            — operator called remove directly
#   owned-skip        — owned by another active session (registry or pgrep match)
#   grace-period      — within WORKTREE_CLEAN_GRACE_HOURS, not safe to remove yet
#   open-pr           — branch has an open PR; active work in progress
#   zero-commit-dirty — 0 commits ahead + dirty files = in-progress, not merged
#   dirty-skip        — uncommitted changes present, --force-merged not set
#   fixture           — test fixture teardown path
#
# Environment:
#   AIDEVOPS_CLEANUP_LOG — override log file path (default: ~/.aidevops/logs/cleanup_worktrees.log)
#
# Compatibility: bash 3.2+ (macOS default). Uses printf, not echo -e.
# Fail-open: log write failures are silently swallowed — callers must not depend on
# this helper succeeding for their own logic.

# Guard against double-sourcing

#   $3  wt_path     — absolute path to the worktree
#   $4  reason      — short reason string (see Reason values above)
