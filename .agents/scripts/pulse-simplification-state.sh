# pulse-simplification-state.sh — Simplification hash-registry state management.
#
# Extracted from pulse-simplification.sh in t2020 (GH#18483) as the surgical
# split to clear the 2,000-line simplification gate that was blocking #18420
# (t1993: schedule post-merge-review-scanner.sh).
#
# This module contains the self-contained sub-cluster of functions that read,
# write, refresh, prune, push, and backfill .agents/configs/simplification-state.json
# — the shared hash registry the simplification routine uses to detect which
# files have been processed, how many passes they have been through, and whether
# they have converged.
#
# Why a separate module? The parent file (pulse-simplification.sh) had grown to
# 2,058 lines — 58 over the large-file simplification gate threshold — which
# deadlocked any dispatch that named the file as an implementation target. The
# state cluster is the largest self-contained sub-cluster in the parent file:
# its 7 functions only call each other, _complexity_scan_has_existing_issue
# (resolved at call time via Bash name resolution since both modules are sourced
# from pulse-wrapper.sh), and standard shell/gh/jq builtins. No call graph
# rewiring is needed — this is a pure move.
#
# This module is sourced by pulse-wrapper.sh immediately after
# pulse-simplification.sh. It MUST NOT be executed directly — it relies on the
# orchestrator having sourced:
#   shared-constants.sh
#   worker-lifecycle-common.sh
#   pulse-simplification.sh   (source order: state AFTER parent, since parent
#                              defines _complexity_scan_has_existing_issue which
#                              _simplification_state_backfill_closed calls.
#                              Bash resolves function names at call time, so
#                              the inverse order would also work, but keeping
#                              state after parent reads left-to-right as
#                              "parent, then the state sub-cluster extracted
#                              from it".)
#
# Functions in this module (in source order):
#   - _simplification_state_check
#   - _simplification_state_record
#   - _simplification_state_refresh
#   - _simplification_state_prune
#   - _simplification_state_push
#   - _create_requeue_issue
#   - _simplification_backfill_extract_file_path            (helper, GH#18680)
#   - _simplification_backfill_update_entry_state           (helper, GH#18680)
#   - _simplification_backfill_verify_remaining_smells      (helper, GH#18680)
#   - _simplification_state_backfill_closed
#   - _simplification_close_spurious_requeue_issues          (defensive, GH#18795)
#
# The three _simplification_backfill_* helpers were extracted from
# _simplification_state_backfill_closed in GH#18680 to keep the orchestrator
# under the 100-line function-complexity gate. The public call contract
# (same args, same stdout, same state file mutations, same log lines) is
# unchanged. All other function bodies remain byte-identical to the pre-
# extraction (t2020) form.
#
# _simplification_close_spurious_requeue_issues (GH#18795) is a defensive
# sweep that auto-closes any open re-queue issues whose title says
# "0 smells remaining" AND whose target file currently has zero Qlty smells.
# It catches stragglers from the pre-PR-#18848 grep-c bug and self-heals any
# future regression of the same class.

# Include guard — prevent double-sourcing.

## Post-merge smell verification (automated — t1912)

**File:** \`${file_path}\`
**Qlty smells remaining:** ${remaining_smells}
**Pass:** ${pass_count} of ${max_passes} max
**Previous issue:** #${prev_issue_num}

The previous simplification pass (issue #${prev_issue_num}) merged successfully but Qlty still reports ${remaining_smells} smell(s) on this file. This follow-up issue was created automatically by the post-merge verification step.

### Context from previous pass

Review issue #${prev_issue_num} for what the previous attempt accomplished and what trade-offs were made. Build on that work rather than starting from scratch.

### Proposed action

1. Run \`~/.qlty/bin/qlty smells --all "${file_path}"\` to identify the specific remaining smells
2. Address the flagged complexity — reduce function length, extract helpers, simplify control flow
3. Verify: \`~/.qlty/bin/qlty smells --all 2>&1 | grep '${file_path}' | grep -c . | grep -q '^0$'\` (report \`SKIP\` if Qlty unavailable)${escalation_note}

**Reference pattern:** \`.agents/reference/large-file-split.md\` (playbook for file splits — covers orchestrator pattern, identity-key preservation, and PR body template).

**Precedent in this repo:** \`issue-sync-helper.sh\` + \`issue-sync-lib.sh\` (simple split) and \`headless-runtime-lib.sh\` + sub-libraries (complex split). For shell scripts, copy the include-guard and SCRIPT_DIR-fallback pattern from the simple precedent.

**Expected CI gate overrides:** This PR may trigger a complexity regression from function extraction. Apply the \`complexity-bump-ok\` label AND include a \`## Complexity Bump Justification\` section in the PR body citing scanner evidence. See the playbook section 4 (Known CI False-Positive Classes).

### Verification

- Qlty smells resolved or reduced for the target file
- Content preservation: all task IDs, URLs, code blocks present before and after
- ShellCheck clean (for .sh files)

#   $1 - repo_path       (absolute worktree path)
#   $2 - file_path       (repo-relative)
#   $3 - aidevops_slug   (owner/repo for issue creation)

# Side effects:
#   - Writes one line to $LOGFILE describing the outcome (clean / re-queued
#     / skipped duplicate) when Qlty is available.
	#   - May call _create_requeue_issue (defined earlier in this file) to open
	#     a follow-up function-complexity-debt issue.
# Returns: 0 always (this is an advisory step; failures should not abort
#          the surrounding backfill loop).

# Defensive auto-close sweep for spurious "0 smells remaining" re-queue
# issues (GH#18795). The pre-PR-#18848 grep-c bug in
# _simplification_backfill_verify_remaining_smells produced literal "0\n0"
# strings that failed the -eq 0 test and cascaded into re-queue issues for
# files Qlty had already reported clean. PR #18848 fixed the bug, but
# stragglers from before that fix landed lingered in the open backlog and
# burned worker dispatches (#18796, #18797, #18798, #18799, #18809, #18829).
#
# This sweep runs each pulse cycle and closes any open re-queue issue where
# BOTH conditions hold:
#   1. The title contains "(pass N, ... 0 smells remaining)" — the
#      diagnostic signature of the bug. Tolerates the "0\n0" newline-
#      corrupted form by stripping whitespace before matching.
#   2. The target file currently has zero Qlty smells per a fresh probe.
#      The probe is the gate — if Qlty reports any smells the issue is
#      legitimate (rare title coincidence) and is left open.
#
# Both conditions are required so a buggy title alone never auto-closes a
# legitimate finding. The function is a no-op when Qlty is not installed.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - repo_path      (absolute worktree path)
#   $2 - aidevops_slug  (owner/repo for issue queries/closures)
# Outputs:
#   Integer count of issues closed to stdout.
# Side effects:
#   - One log line per close attempt (success or failure) to $LOGFILE.
#   - Closes matching issues with reason "not planned" plus a rationale
#     comment that links to PR #18848 (the original fix) and #18795 (the
#     defensive sweep itself).
# Returns: 0 always (advisory step; failures must not abort the surrounding
#          state-refresh stage).
