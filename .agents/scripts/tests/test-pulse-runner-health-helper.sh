# Unit tests for pulse-runner-health-helper.sh (t2897).
#
# Coverage:
#   1. Fresh state: status reports uninitialised.
#   2. Counter increments on each zero-attempt signal.
#   3. Counter resets on a real-attempt outcome (any non-zero-attempt signal).
#   4. is-paused returns 1 (closed) below threshold.
#   5. is-paused returns 0 (tripped) when threshold reached.
#   6. Window expiry: counter resets after RUNNER_HEALTH_WINDOW_HOURS pass.
#   7. Pause/resume idempotency: calling twice doesn't break state.
#   8. Advisory dedup: trip→trip without state change emits ONE advisory.
#   9. Advisory regenerates on resume→trip cycle (state change).
#  10. Status --json emits valid JSON.
#  11. RUNNER_HEALTH_DISABLED=1 short-circuits all subcommands.
#  12. Recognised zero-attempt signals (4 listed in the helper).
#  13. Unrecognised signal acts as real-attempt (resets counter).
#
# All tests run inside an isolated sandbox HOME; no system state is touched.
