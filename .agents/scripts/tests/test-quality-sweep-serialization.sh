# t1992: Regression test for the daily quality sweep serialization.
#
# The original implementation of `_run_sweep_tools` / `_quality_sweep_for_repo`
# wrote 12 fields with `printf '%s\n'` and read them back with `IFS= read -r`.
# That pattern only worked for single-line values; every multi-line section
# (ShellCheck, Qlty, SonarCloud, Codacy, CodeRabbit, review_scan) was
# truncated to its first line, with the remainder leaking into the next
# variable.
#
# This test stubs the per-tool `_sweep_*` functions to return known multi-line
# fixtures and then asserts that each section round-trips byte-for-byte
# through `_run_sweep_tools` (writer) into the caller (reader).
#
# Run:
#   bash .agents/scripts/tests/test-quality-sweep-serialization.sh
#
# shellcheck disable=SC1090,SC1091
