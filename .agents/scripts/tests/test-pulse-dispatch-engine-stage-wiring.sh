# test-pulse-dispatch-engine-stage-wiring.sh — regression guard for t2443
#
# Verifies that post-dispatch housekeeping stages remain independently timed
# and are wired through the async housekeeping launcher, not wrapped in a
# shared-budget group that blocks worker refill.
#
# Background: _preflight_daily_scans() wrapped 4+ children under a single
# 600s timeout. A slow complexity_scan (200-340s) would exhaust the budget
# before auto_decomposer_scanner could run. t2443 promoted each scanner to
# an independent stage so each gets its own timeout budget; t3055 then moved
# those independent stages behind an async post-dispatch lock so housekeeping
# cannot hold the dispatch cycle open while worker slots drain.
