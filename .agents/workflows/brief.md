# Brief Composition Agent

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all GitHub-written content — briefs, issue bodies, PR descriptions, comments, escalation reports
- **Key principle**: Every piece of written output is mentorship for the next reader (human or model). Transfer the knowledge they need to succeed.
- **Evidence**: 47-PR research corpus — 100% Haiku success with exact oldString/newString, 0% with descriptive prose.
- **Template**: `templates/brief-template.md`
- **Escalation template**: `templates/escalation-report-template.md`
- **Tier criteria**: `reference/task-taxonomy.md`

## Core Rule

**The brief IS the product.** A vague brief dispatched to Opus wastes more money than a prescriptive brief dispatched to Haiku. Invest the effort in the brief, not the worker.

## Tier Classification

Assess every work item against these empirical criteria (from 47-PR research):

| Criterion | tier:simple | tier:standard | tier:thinking |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Files** | Single file | 2-3 files with coordination | 4+ files or architectural |
| **Lines changed** | Under 100 | 100-500 | 500+ or novel design |
| **Pattern** | Follows existing pattern | Adapts pattern to new context | Creates new pattern |
| **Code provided** | Exact oldString/newString | Skeletons with signatures | Approach description |
| **Judgment needed** | None — mechanical execution | Error recovery, approach selection | Design decisions, trade-offs |
| **Examples** | Review feedback, config tweaks, quote fixes, docs additions | Bug fixes, refactors, feature impl | Architecture, security audits |

**Default to `tier:standard`.** Only downgrade to `tier:simple` when the brief provides exact, copy-pasteable `oldString`/`newString` for every edit, the target file is under 500 lines, and no judgment or codebase exploration is required. See `reference/task-taxonomy.md` "tier:simple Disqualifiers" — if any disqualifier applies, use `tier:standard` or higher.

## The Mentorship Principle

Every piece of GitHub-written content mentors the next reader. Apply these checks:

| Question | If NO → fix |
|----------|-------------|
| Does this tell the reader WHERE to look? | Add file paths with line ranges |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT to do? | Add exact code or clear steps |
| Does this tell the reader HOW to verify? | Add verification commands |
| Does this tell the reader WHEN they are done? | Add a concrete completion signal |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT to do when stuck? | Add fallback/recovery steps |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT was already tried? | Add prior attempt context (escalation, kill comments) |
| Could a cheaper model execute this? | Make it more prescriptive |

A dispatch comment that says "implement issue #42" teaches nothing. One that says "edit `src/auth.ts:45` — replace `([^0-9]|$)` with `\b` — verify with `shellcheck src/auth.ts`" enables tier:simple dispatch.

## Headless Continuation Resilience

Briefs consumed by headless workers must anticipate empty results, wrong paths, and ambiguous states. Every brief section should answer: "what does the worker do when this step produces nothing?" Mandatory requirements — completion signals, recovery paths, fallback patterns — see `brief/tier-standard.md`.

## How to Use This Agent

- **Routing**: See `brief/routing.md` for when to use this agent (work item creation, comments, PR descriptions)
- **Tier-specific formats**:
  - `tier:simple` → `brief/tier-simple.md` (prescriptive, exact code blocks)
  - `tier:standard` → `brief/tier-standard.md` (skeletons, judgment required)
  - `tier:thinking` → `brief/tier-thinking.md` (problem space, constraints)
- **Templates**: `brief/templates.md` (issue body, comments, PR description, review comment)

## Callers: How to Reference This Agent

Agents that write GitHub content should include a pointer rather than duplicating formatting rules:

```markdown
Format the {finding/brief/issue body/comment/PR description} using `workflows/brief.md`
for the classified tier. Load on demand — do not inline the format rules.
```
