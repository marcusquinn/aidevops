# Brief Composition Agent

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all GitHub-written content — briefs, issue bodies, PR descriptions, comments, escalation reports
- **Historical evidence**: A 47-PR bounded-worker corpus completed exact `oldString`/`newString` contracts reliably and failed on descriptive prose.
- **Template**: `~/.aidevops/agents/templates/brief-template.md`
- **Escalation template**: `templates/escalation-report-template.md`
- **Tier criteria**: `reference/task-taxonomy.md`

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Pre-composition Checks (MANDATORY)

Before composing any brief, issue body, or PR description that will result in code changes, perform ALL of the following checks. These consolidate three mandatory rules from `AGENTS.md` (t2046, t2050, GH#17832-17835) into the briefing workflow.

### 1. Memory recall (t2050)

```bash
memory-helper.sh recall --query "<1-3 keyword phrase from task>" --limit 5
```

Surface accumulated lessons from prior sessions. Read any hits BEFORE drafting the brief — a lesson that says "skipped discovery pass, duplicated 500 lines" tells you exactly what to do differently.

### 2. Discovery pass (t2046)

For any brief that targets specific files, run:

```bash
git log --since="<issue-age + 2h>" --oneline -- <target-files>
gh pr list --state merged --search "<keywords>" --limit 5
gh pr list --state open --search "<keywords>" --limit 5
```

**If any result touches the target files**: STOP. Re-assess whether the task is still valid. Route to "Already-shipped" or "In-flight collision" (see `brief/routing.md`).

### 3. File:line verification (GH#17832-17835)

For every file reference in the brief, confirm it exists and the content matches:

```bash
git ls-files <path>           # verify file exists
sed -n '<line>p' <path>       # verify line content matches claim
```

Briefs with phantom line references waste worker cycles. Every `file:line` claim must be verified against the current `HEAD` before filing.

### 4. Tier contract check

Classify with `reference/task-taxonomy.md` "Canonical Assignment Policy" BEFORE
choosing a tier. Select `tier:thinking` for consequential unresolved decisions,
select `tier:simple` only when every prescriptive execution-contract condition is
proven, and otherwise use `tier:standard`. Counts, estimates, and isolated words
are evidence rather than gates. Server-side checks enforce only explicit checklist,
contract, and dispatch-path invariants; composition owns the judgment.

For long-running shell/framework tasks, add a recoverability checkpoint to the
brief: exercise the affected production-facing path or run the narrowest
applicable existing check, create a WIP commit before broad lint/release gates,
then continue verification. This prevents runtime/watchdog failures from leaving
only dirty local edits for pulse recovery.

If a safety fuse can trip, also include the Safety-Stop Recovery fields from
`reference/safety-stop-recovery.md`. A fuse never fulfils acceptance criteria:
the brief must preserve the original objective, remaining criteria, next safer
route, and resume condition. Keep the task open until completion, explicit user
cancellation, or demonstrated impossibility.

### 5. Self-assignment awareness (t2406)

If filing via `gh_create_issue` with `auto-dispatch` label, plan to unassign immediately after:

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --repo <slug> --remove-assignee <user>
```

The wrapper currently self-assigns in violation of t2157. Until t2406/GH#19991 merges, manual unassign is required to avoid dispatch-blocking.

### 6. Files Scope for auto-dispatch (GH#32531)

Every `auto-dispatch` implementation issue body needs a canonical scope section,
or the pulse holds it as `status:blocked` (`missing_files_scope`) before any
worker starts. `## Files` and prose file lists do not count. Explicit
`` `EDIT: path[:lines]` `` / `` `NEW: path` `` bullets under `### Files to Modify`
(including `` and `other/path` `` continuations) are normalized: the pulse appends
the derived Files Scope to trusted bodies instead of holding them. A held issue
is released automatically once its edited body passes; do not clear the label
by hand without fixing the body, or the next cycle re-holds it.

```markdown
### Files Scope

- `.agents/scripts/example-helper.sh`
- `.agents/scripts/example-helper-test.sh`
```

One exact repository-relative path per line (no globs or `EDIT:`/`NEW:` prefixes),
nothing after it; list tests and docs the worker must touch. Put descriptions,
hard boundaries and recovery guidance in a sibling section. Verify before publishing:
`pre-dispatch-validator-helper.sh scope-check <N> "$(cat body.md)" 1` (exit 0).
Interactive `claim-task-id.sh --labels auto-dispatch` refuses a description
without it, and the `gh_create_issue` PATH command refuses an unscoped
`auto-dispatch` body; scripts that source the library only warn (GH#32880).
Also list any test file a required CI gate will demand
(for example platform/bash-compat fixes need a changed test). Planning-only
issues start with `Planning-only:` instead.

For work requiring runner-local credentials during verification or publication,
declare **names only** with one `needs-secret:NAME` label per name. Alternatively
put `<!-- aidevops:needs-secrets NAME1 NAME2 -->` in the issue body when labels
are impractical. Labels take precedence when both are present. Never include
secret values; names in either form remain visible to issue readers. A runner
without every named secret silently yields before claiming.

## Dispatch Readiness Contract (brief schema v2)

New briefs intended for auto-dispatch use `<!-- aidevops:brief-schema=v2 -->`
from `~/.aidevops/agents/templates/brief-template.md`. Before adding `auto-dispatch` or moving the
issue to `status:queued`, run `verify-brief-helper.sh check-readiness <brief>`.
Unmarked historical briefs retain the legacy heading-based check and are not
retroactively blocked.

Schema-v2 briefs must contain substantive, evidence-backed content for all of
the following; headings or `N/A` alone do not pass:

1. **Complete Write Surface:** search and record callers/readers,
   writers/mutation paths, tests/fixtures, schemas/config, generated or
   deployed mirrors, migrations/backfills, and cleanup/rollback paths. Name
   concrete paths. Use `N/A` or "not yet knowable" only with the search or
   task-shape evidence that makes it true, including documentation-only and
   new-file-only work.
2. **Hazards and Compatibility:** assess concurrency/atomicity,
   migration/rollback ordering, mixed-version/backward compatibility,
   idempotency/retry behavior, and partial-failure recovery. State the
   preserved behavior when a hazard is absent.
3. **Verification Before Dispatch:** provide executable focused commands and
   map each command to the affected surfaces. Add a broad gate only when named
   blast-radius evidence requires one.
4. **Acceptance Criteria:** include at least two observable criteria with both
   positive behavior and a negative/regression guarantee.

The version marker is the compatibility boundary. Do not add it to an old
brief unless that brief has been migrated to this complete contract.

## Core Rule

**The executable contract is the product.** A vague brief wastes high-capability reasoning, while a mechanically complete brief can run reliably at a lower workload tier. Invest in decision-relevant context, not length, repetition, question quotas, or token quotas.

### Reader-first rendering

Rendered GitHub content serves people and workers from the same source:

1. Put the outcome, reason, and completion conditions in the initial reading path.
2. State each full fact or section once; a short reader summary may index the detailed contract.
3. Collapse long implementation, provenance, and audit sections instead of deleting them.
4. Preserve exact paths, commands, constraints, hazards, recovery steps, and acceptance criteria under stable headings in the raw body.
5. Humanise surrounding prose, not technical identifiers or verification evidence.

For maintained repositories, publishing a worker-ready implementation issue is
the decision to implement it. Add `auto-dispatch` at creation and do not ask for
a second dispatch approval. If the user explicitly chose later/manual handling,
keep the work as a local TODO/plan instead; reserve `no-auto-dispatch` for a
durable hold whose reason is recorded on the issue.

## Ordered Work / Dependencies

When composing TODOs or issues that must run in sequence, include the textual
`blocked-by:*` or `blocks:*` marker for auditability and ensure the GitHub native
issue relationship is or will be synced. Treat GitHub's `blockedBy` relationship
as the primary dispatch gate; body markers are fallback intent for
`issue-sync-relationships.sh` and Pulse repair.

For an ordered worker-ready chain, the first leaf uses `#auto-dispatch` with
`status:available`; every later leaf uses `#auto-dispatch` with `status:blocked`
after its native relationship is verified. During publication, fail closed:
never expose a dependent leaf as available before the edge is verified. If the
edge cannot be resolved, retain `status:blocked` and repair the relationship.
Once every blocker closes, Pulse changes the next leaf to `status:available`;
the completing worker closes only its own leaf and does not edit its successor.
Independent children may remain `status:available` for parallel dispatch, while
the roadmap parent keeps `parent-task` and never receives `#auto-dispatch`.

## Seeded Draft PR Decision

When an issue or brief is created after enough discovery to know the likely implementation path, the author MAY open a seeded draft PR that gives the worker verified implementation context. This is opt-in. Issue-only remains the default when confidence is not high.

### Seed only when ALL criteria hold

- **Fresh discovery:** memory recall, duplicate/in-flight discovery, and file-ref verification were completed in this session against current `HEAD`.
- **Verified files:** every seeded change references existing files and line ranges checked immediately before composing the PR; new-file paths have verified parent directories.
- **High-confidence pattern:** the implementation follows an existing pattern or exact skeleton already captured in the brief.
- **Honest verification state:** any tests, lint, or build commands already run are named with results; unrun checks are explicitly marked unverified.
- **Draft safety:** the PR is opened as a draft, linked to the issue/brief, and clearly says it is a seed for continuation, not merge-ready work.

### Do NOT seed when any caution applies

- The target code is moving quickly or discovery found recent related commits/PRs that need reassessment.
- The likely implementation depends on design judgment, credentials, production state, or a human decision.
- The seed would anchor the worker to an untested hypothesis instead of evidence.
- The author cannot describe how to verify the seeded approach.
- The PR would be easy to mistake for ready-to-merge work.

### Required seeded PR content

Seeded draft PR bodies must mentor the next worker with:

- Issue link using `For #NNN` while the PR is draft-only; switch to the normal closing keyword only when the PR becomes the final implementation PR.
- Files and line ranges already verified.
- What was implemented or only sketched.
- Verification already run, plus explicit `UNVERIFIED` items.
- Stale-assumption warning: what would make the seed wrong and what to re-check before continuing.

Record the decision in `~/.aidevops/agents/templates/brief-template.md` under **Seeded Draft PR** whether a seed was created or intentionally skipped.

## Tier Classification

Use `reference/task-taxonomy.md` as the single policy source. In order:

1. Consequential unresolved decision or dispatch-path override → `tier:thinking`.
2. Complete, verified, reversible, low-consequence execution contract with no
   remaining judgment or coordination design → `tier:simple`.
3. Everything else → `tier:standard`.

Security wording alone does not select a tier. A bounded implementation inside a
decided trust boundary is normally standard; deciding the boundary is thinking;
an exact security-adjacent edit that changes no effective boundary may be simple.

## The Mentorship Principle

Every piece of GitHub-written content mentors the next reader. Apply these checks:

| Question | If NO → fix |
|----------|-------------|
| Does this tell the reader WHERE to look? | Add file paths with line ranges |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT to do? | Add exact code or clear steps |
| Does this tell the reader HOW to verify? | Add verification commands |
| Does this tell the reader WHEN they are done? | Add a concrete completion signal |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT to do when stuck? | Add fallback/recovery steps |
| Does this tell the reader WHAT was already tried? | Add prior attempt context (escalation, kill comments) |
| Could a lower workload tier execute this reliably? | Resolve ambiguity or add exact interfaces without fabricating decisions |

A dispatch comment that says "implement issue #42" teaches nothing. One that says "edit `src/auth.ts:45` — replace `([^0-9]|$)` with `\b` — verify with `shellcheck src/auth.ts`" enables tier:simple dispatch.

At implementation review, record material deviations from the brief and verification gaps in the existing PR summary/review evidence. Routine work that followed the brief does not require a separate implementation-notes artifact.

Verification commands must also mentor efficient execution. Brief ordinary code
work with the affected production-facing path plus applicable existing checks
and changed-file or affected-package lint/typecheck. Add focused test coverage
only under `reference/ci-gate-policy.md`.
Include a full-repository gate only when named blast-radius evidence requires it
(shared config, root tooling, dependency graph, cross-package contracts, or
release infrastructure); never use `linters-local.sh --full` as generic
completion evidence. Release and postflight reuse terminal evidence for the
exact SHA instead of duplicating source scans.

## How to Use This Agent

- **Routing**: See `brief/routing.md` for when to use this agent (work item creation, comments, PR descriptions)
- **Headless resilience**: Anticipate empty results, wrong paths, ambiguous states in headless briefs. Every step should answer "what if this returns nothing?" Details: `brief/tier-standard.md`
- **Progressive context**: For tasks with 3+ workflow/reference docs or >2,000 reference lines, include `### Progressive Context Plan` from `~/.aidevops/agents/templates/brief-template.md` so workers know what to load, when, why, and when to stop.
- **UI/UX briefs**: Include repo `DESIGN.md` status/path, the relevant rule or canonical example, similar-but-different alternatives considered, and a responsive/accessibility verification plan. Point to `tools/design/design-md.md` and `workflows/ui-verification.md`; do not inline a full design template.
- **Tier-specific formats**:
  - `tier:simple` → `brief/tier-simple.md` (prescriptive, exact code blocks)
  - `tier:standard` → `brief/tier-standard.md` (skeletons, judgment required)
  - `tier:thinking` → `brief/tier-thinking.md` (problem space, constraints)
- **Templates**: `brief/templates.md` (issue body, comments, PR description, review comment)

## Callers: How to Reference This Agent

Agents that write GitHub content should include a pointer rather than duplicating formatting rules:

```markdown
Format the {finding/brief/issue body/comment/PR description} using `workflows/brief.md`
for the classified tier. Load on demand — do not inline the format rules.
```
