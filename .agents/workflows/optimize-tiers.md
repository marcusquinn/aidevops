# /optimize-tiers

Use production dispatch telemetry and deterministic historical replay to evaluate
model-tier and reasoning-effort changes. Do not change routing from benchmark
results until the result is confirmed and consistent with production evidence.

Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Production telemetry

### `/optimize-tiers report`

Show current tier dispatch telemetry from production data:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/dispatch-ledger-helper.sh tier-report
```

Outputs include dispatches, outcomes, escalation counts, pass rates, and dominant
failure reasons by tier. Telemetry is recorded automatically by:

- `dispatch-ledger-helper.sh register` — records tier + model at dispatch time
- `dispatch-ledger-helper.sh record-outcome` — records outcome + escalation reason
- Append-only log: `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/tmp/tier-telemetry.jsonl`

## Historical replay

Keep corpora, repository catalogs, candidate files, prompts, patches, artifacts,
results, and reports outside Git under a private local directory. Never publish
private repository identities or archived prompts.

The local benchmark operator and curated checks are trusted. Integrity hashes,
read-only prediction files, exclusive result appends, and run locks detect drift
and ordinary tampering; they are not cryptographic attestation against a
malicious process already running as the same local account.

```bash
ROOT="${HOME}/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/work/model-replay"
CORPUS="${ROOT}/corpus"
CATALOG="${ROOT}/repositories.json"
CANDIDATES="${ROOT}/candidates.json"
EXPERIMENT="${ROOT}/experiments/quick-primary-autonomous"
HELPER="${HOME}/.aidevops/agents/scripts/brief-tier-test-helper.sh"
```

### 1. Initialise and populate the corpus

```bash
"$HELPER" init --corpus "$CORPUS"
```

The default design requires three repository profiles, nine quick cases, and
eighteen full cases. For each case, archive:

- the exact historical prompt, or explicitly mark a reconstruction;
- an immutable full base commit SHA;
- a reference patch kept unavailable to the model;
- deterministic `fail_to_pass` and `pass_to_pass` command arrays;
- provenance, visibility, merge date, expected tier, and supported replay modes.

Register each case with `add-case`, then edit the generated local repository
catalog so each repository key resolves to a local canonical checkout. The
catalog is never passed to the model.

```bash
"$HELPER" add-case \
  --corpus "$CORPUS" \
  --case-id CASE_ID \
  --repo-key REPOSITORY_KEY \
  --profile PROFILE \
  --tier simple \
  --base-sha FULL_COMMIT_SHA \
  --prompt-file ARCHIVED_PROMPT \
  --gold-patch REFERENCE_PATCH \
  --checks-file HIDDEN_CHECKS_JSON \
  --visibility private \
  --quick

"$HELPER" qualify \
  --corpus "$CORPUS" \
  --catalog "$CATALOG" \
  --repetitions 3
```

Qualification fails closed unless the target checks fail on the base, regression
checks pass on the base, all checks pass after the reference patch, prompt scans
pass, and repeated outcomes are deterministic. It resolves the exact full commit,
rejects base symlinks and gitlinks, and runs checks with a minimal environment
that excludes parent credentials and Git overrides.

### 2. Configure candidates

Create a local candidate JSON file using schema
`aidevops-model-replay-candidates/v1`. It requires:

- an explicit provider allowlist;
- one `provider/model`, tier, primary effort, and supported effort list per model;
- the `opencode` runtime and a bounded timeout;
- a knowledge cutoff for public cases.

Anthropic-family providers and models are rejected by policy, including Claude
models exposed through another provider. Use only providers explicitly approved
for the experiment.

### 3. Plan and seal predictions

Create separate experiment directories for autonomous and prescriptive replay.
The modes must never be aggregated.

```bash
"$HELPER" plan \
  --corpus "$CORPUS" \
  --candidates "$CANDIDATES" \
  --experiment "$EXPERIMENT" \
  --experiment-id quick-primary-autonomous \
  --suite quick \
  --stage primary \
  --mode autonomous \
  --execution-posture enforced
```

The default `enforced` posture requires verified provider-only process-tree
egress. For a curated V1 experiment on an operator-controlled machine, select
`--execution-posture trusted-local` explicitly. The posture is sealed into the
plan and cannot be changed later; create a new experiment to change it.

Fill every field in `prediction-template.json` before any provider call, then
seal it. The CLI will not replace or reseal an existing prediction ledger.

```bash
"$HELPER" seal \
  --experiment "$EXPERIMENT" \
  --input "${ROOT}/predictions/quick-primary-autonomous.json"

"$HELPER" run \
  --experiment "$EXPERIMENT" \
  --corpus "$CORPUS" \
  --catalog "$CATALOG" \
  --dry-run
```

The dry run holds the experiment lock, validates the corpus, catalog, exact base
trees, plan, candidate, prediction, and runtime seals, makes zero provider calls,
and writes a reproducible report.

### Bounded pilot

`configs/model-effort-pilot.json` defines a portable three-case pilot and its public
source metadata. Pass a local file containing its `budget` object to `plan --budget`.
The sealed receipt reserves launches before execution and does not refund an
interrupted launch on resume. See `reference/model-effort-pilot.md` for the approved
runner recipe and limitations.

### 4. Execute and interpret

```bash
"$HELPER" run \
  --experiment "$EXPERIMENT" \
  --corpus "$CORPUS" \
  --catalog "$CATALOG"

"$HELPER" report --experiment "$EXPERIMENT"
```

Each cell runs in a fresh synthetic one-commit linked worktree with no remote or
later history. Correctness comes only from hidden deterministic checks; diff
similarity and LLM grading are excluded. Reports compare completion, functional
correctness, model/effort evidence, duration, cost when observed, failure class,
pairwise separation, and sealed-prediction calibration.

Every execution posture requires the restricted OpenCode profile, scoped
provider auth, isolated sandbox, disabled MCP/subagents/shell/network tools, and
concrete provider-request plus resource evidence. The captured patch is reapplied
to another clean synthetic base and regraded; prompt, log, metrics, and patch
hashes remain bound to the append-only result record.

OpenCode's built-in provider-auth plugins remain available for scoped OAuth;
`OPENCODE_PURE=1` still excludes external plugins and the restricted profile
prevents those built-ins from expanding the model replay tool boundary.

Dry runs never contact providers and do not require an egress backend. Before an
`enforced` real run, set `AIDEVOPS_WORKER_EGRESS_BACKEND` to an absolute
executable that implements the v1 kernel/equivalent contract documented by
`sandbox-exec-helper.sh`; the run fails before provider execution when this
trusted operator prerequisite is absent. Never use a test fixture backend.

`trusted-local` deliberately records that process-tree egress was not enforced.
It is only for curated local experiments on an operator-controlled machine. Its
correctness, cost, duration, identity, and resource observations remain visible,
but reports quarantine them from automatic routing or release recommendations.
It never weakens public triage, worker, or other runtime roles.
Each deterministic check receives a disposable patch snapshot in a separate
filesystem-deny sandbox, so check-time writes cannot affect later checks. The
enforcing backends are macOS Seatbelt and Linux Bubblewrap. Linux requires an
executable `/usr/bin/bwrap` or `/bin/bwrap`; the sandbox uses a new mount,
process, user, and network namespace, grants write access only to the disposable
snapshot and its isolated HOME/TMP/XDG tree, and mounts only required system
runtime paths read-only. Qualification and grading fail before running checks
when the platform backend is missing or cannot establish those namespaces,
rather than exposing hidden corpus, operator state, results, runtime data, or
sibling workspaces.

Use stages in order:

1. `canary` — one simple case per profile; stop if no candidate passes.
2. `primary` — quick-suite comparison at each candidate's primary effort.
3. `sweep` — effort variants on discriminator cases when primary is unresolved.
4. `confirm` — repeated route-changing candidates before a full-suite run.

Non-fresh cases admitted by explicit override remain quarantined from routing
recommendations. Unknown model identity or unsupported effective effort cannot
produce a passing result.

## Migration from the placeholder harness

The former `extract`, `enrich`, `test`, and `score` commands intentionally fail.
They relied on provider-branded assumptions, diff similarity, and unsealed
results. Replace them as follows:

| Removed command | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `extract` | Curate locally, then `init` and `add-case` |
| `enrich` | Optional `--prescriptive-file` on `add-case` |
| `test` | `plan`, `seal`, `run` |
| `score` | `report` |

Do not automatically mutate brief templates or routing. First confirm the result
on repeated quick and full replay, then compare it with production telemetry and
review the proposed routing change separately.
