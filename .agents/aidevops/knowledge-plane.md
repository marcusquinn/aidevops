# Knowledge Plane — Directory Contract

The knowledge plane is an opt-in file staging area for AI-assisted ingestion of
external documents, data exports, and reference material into aidevops-managed
repos. Each repo can independently enable or disable the plane.

For cross-plane routing metadata, use `.agents/configs/data-planes.json` as the
canonical registry. This document owns the `_knowledge/` directory contract; the
registry owns shared facts such as default sensitivity, ingress/egress, helper,
and retrieval surfaces.

## Quick Contract

- Modes: `repos.json` `knowledge` field supports `off` (default), `repo`, and
  `personal`.
- Repo mode root: `<repo>/_knowledge/`; personal mode root:
  `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/knowledge/`.
- Versioned knowledge lives in `sources/` and `collections/`; raw `inbox/`,
  curated `staging/`, and generated `index/` are gitignored by default.
- Contract v1 gives each immutable raw item one corpus-scoped `ev1:` identity.
  `_knowledge` owns that evidence; indexes and cross-plane records retain
  validated `pr1:` projections or pointers rather than copying authority.
- Provision with `aidevops knowledge init repo`, `aidevops knowledge init personal`,
  or idempotently repair with `aidevops knowledge provision`.
- Files ≥30MB are routed to the local blob store and represented by committed
  `meta.json` stubs.
- Bounded folder imports recursively inventory mixed media, deduplicate immutable
  bytes, and retain replay/deletion coverage in private index manifests.
- LLM, email, review, indexing, and enrichment behaviour is detailed in the
  chapter files below.
- Affiliate observations use `scripts/affiliate-helper.sh` and the authenticated
  `personal:default` corpus: canonical `sources/affiliate/raw/` evidence and a
  rebuildable `index/affiliate.json` projection. Requirements and dry-run signup
  preparation are public/offline; private retrieval/import retain existing grants.
  See `marketing-sales/affiliate-programmes.md`; no live signup adapter is enabled.

## Preservation Notes

This file is intentionally a slim index. The previous inline sections were moved
without semantic changes into the chapter files above so agents can load only the
matching topic while retaining all command examples, URLs, task IDs, schemas, and
policy rationale.
