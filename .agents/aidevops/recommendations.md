# Best Practices & Provider Selection Guide

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Hosting**: Hostinger (managed WordPress convenience/value), Hetzner (self-managed control/price-performance), Cloudflare (edge/static/headless and global delivery)
- **Deployment**: Coolify (self-hosted PaaS), Cloudron (easy app management)
- **Operating systems**: [Contextual OS selection](../reference/os-selection.md) — opinionated desktop/server/dev/security starting points, gated by workload, vendor support, architecture, actual provider images, licensing, and user priorities
- **DNS**: Cloudflare (CDN/security), Spaceship (modern), 101domains (large portfolios), Route 53 (AWS)
- **Security**: API tokens in `~/.config/aidevops/`, never in repo, rotate quarterly
- **SSH**: Ed25519 keys, standardize across servers, passphrase protection
- **Local Dev**: `.local` suffix, SSL by default, port ranges (WordPress 10000+, APIs 8000+, MCP 8080+)
- **MCP Ports**: Sequential allocation starting from base 8081
- **Monitoring**: Weekly status checks, monthly token rotation, quarterly audits

## Provider Selection

Select by the user's priorities rather than provider familiarity. Establish the
desired operating burden, workload shape, budget, traffic geography, data-location
needs, support expectations, and existing stack, then verify current plans, limits,
regions, backups, and pricing before committing.

Apply [OS selection](../reference/os-selection.md) before choosing an image or
installation command: Omarchy/Kubuntu for suitable desktops, Alpine for minimal
compatible workloads, Rocky for general servers and supported Coolify deployments,
vendor-required Ubuntu x64 for Cloudron, AlmaLinux for verified ecosystem fits,
NixOS for reproducible environments, and Parrot/Kali VM/Tails for distinct security
or privacy needs. Prefer Hetzner ARM only when every required layer supports it.
These preferences do not extend aidevops's own platform-support matrix.

For conventional WordPress, start with Hostinger when managed convenience and
value lead. Prefer Hetzner when server control, custom infrastructure, or
price-performance justify self-management. Prefer Cloudflare for edge-native,
static, or headless delivery and as the global performance/security layer; a
conventional PHP/MySQL WordPress site still needs an origin such as Hostinger or
Hetzner.

### Hosting & Cloud

| Provider | Best For | Operating Model | Key Trade-off | Docs |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|------|
| Hostinger | Conventional managed WordPress | Lower-ops shared/cloud hosting | Convenience and value over low-level server control | [Hostinger guide](../services/hosting/hostinger.md) |
| Hetzner Cloud | Self-managed WordPress and production apps | VPS/dedicated infrastructure | Strong control and price-performance; operator owns hardening, backups, updates, and monitoring | [Hetzner guide](../services/hosting/hetzner.md) |
| Cloudflare | Edge/static/headless workloads and global delivery/security | Edge platform or layer in front of an origin | Not a drop-in PHP/MySQL WordPress origin | [Cloudflare guide](../services/hosting/cloudflare.md) |

## Infrastructure Organization

### Multi-Project Architecture

- **Separate API tokens** per project/client
- **Descriptive naming**: Clear project names (main, client-project, storagebox)
- **Account isolation**: Separate production, development, and client environments
- **Documentation**: Maintain descriptions for each project/account

### Hetzner Account Structure Example

```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "main": { "api_token": "YOUR_MAIN_TOKEN", "description": "Main production account" },
    "client-project": { "api_token": "YOUR_CLIENT_PROJECT_TOKEN", "description": "Client project account" },
    "storagebox": { "api_token": "YOUR_STORAGE_TOKEN", "description": "Storage and backup account" }
  }
}
```

### Hostinger Multi-Site Management

- **Domain-based organization**: Group sites by domain/purpose
- **Consistent paths**: Standard `/domains/[domain]/public_html` structure
- **Password management**: Separate password files per server group
- **Site categorization**: Group by client, project type, or environment

## Security Best Practices

### API Token Management

- Store in `~/.config/aidevops/` (user-private, 600 perms) -- never in repo
- Different tokens for prod/dev/staging
- Rotate quarterly, use least-privilege permissions
- Always add config files to `.gitignore`

### SSH Key Standardization

- Use Ed25519 keys (faster, more secure than RSA)
- Standardize keys across all servers with passphrase protection
- Audit and remove unused keys regularly

### Password Authentication (Hostinger)

- Prefer `aidevops secret set` and inject passwords only into the command subprocess.
- Use `sshpass` only with an injected environment variable or a legacy helper's 600-permission compatibility file.
- Never print or commit passwords; keep any required compatibility file outside Git.

## Domain & SSL Management

### Local Development

- `.local` suffix for all local domains; SSL certificates by default
- Port ranges: WordPress 10000-10999, APIs 8000-8999, MCP 8080+, databases standard (5432/3306/6379)
- Setup `dnsmasq` for automatic `.local` resolution

### LocalWP Integration

```bash
# List LocalWP sites
./.agents/scripts/localhost-helper.sh list-localwp

# Setup custom domain for LocalWP site
./.agents/scripts/localhost-helper.sh setup-localwp-domain plugin-testing plugin-testing.local

# Generate SSL certificate
./.agents/scripts/localhost-helper.sh generate-cert plugin-testing.local
```

Map LocalWP ports to custom `.local` domains. Use Traefik reverse proxy for clean domain access.

### Production SSL

- Let's Encrypt with automated renewal
- Wildcard certificates for multi-subdomain setups
- Monitor expiration dates

## Development Environment

### Docker

- Shared networks for all local containers
- Standardize Traefik labels and volume naming
- Use `.env` files for configuration

### MCP Port Allocation

```json
{
  "mcp_integration": {
    "base_port": 8081,
    "port_allocation": {
      "hostinger": 8080,
      "hetzner-main": 8081,
      "hetzner-client-project": 8082,
      "hetzner-storagebox": 8083
    }
  }
}
```

Sequential allocation from base port. Use descriptive names matching account structure. Monitor MCP server health.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

| Cadence | Tasks |
|---------|-------|
| Weekly | Server status, resource usage |
| Monthly | API token rotation review |
| Quarterly | SSH key audit, access permissions |
| Annually | Security practices review |

Automate: health checks, backup verification, SSL expiration alerts, resource monitoring (CPU/memory/disk).
