# Campaigns Plane — Directory Contract

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

The `_campaigns/` plane is a peer-level user-data plane for marketing/advertising/outreach
work. It houses brand assets, competitive intel, inspiration swipe files, in-flight
campaign creative, and post-launch performance + learnings. It is opt-in per repo.

## Why a Separate Plane

Marketing/campaign work has a distinct shape from other planes:

- **Different lifecycle:** `concept → research → creative → review → distribution → measure → learn`
  (not the build-test-ship cycle of `_projects/`).
- **Different sensitivity profile:** competitive intel is its own tier (never cloud);
  pre-launch creative is confidential; post-launch creative is public.
- **Asset binary heavy:** logos, video, audio — heavy use of the 30MB blob threshold path.
- **Swipe-file pattern:** "I saved this because [creative reason]" with channel/mood
  metadata — doesn't fit `_knowledge/` reference shape.
- **Different agents:** creative director, copywriter, market researcher, distributor —
  none apply to typical software projects.

Without a dedicated plane, marketing work either bloats `_projects/` (wrong lifecycle)
or scatters across the filesystem unmanaged.

**Provision:** `aidevops campaign init`
**Repair:** `aidevops campaign provision` is idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Sub-folder Purposes

| Folder | Versioned | Sensitivity | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `lib/brand/` | Yes | `internal` | Reusable brand identity files (logos, colours, voice) |
| `lib/swipe/` | Yes | `internal` | Inspiration files: saved ads, landing pages, email examples |
| `intel/` | **No** (gitignored) | `sensitive` | Competitive intel — local-LLM-only, never committed |
| `active/<id>/` | **No** (gitignored) | `internal` | In-progress campaign creative (drafts, briefs, schedules) |
| `launched/<id>/` | Yes | varies | Post-launch directory: results + learnings are versioned |
| `_config/` | Yes | `internal` | Plane configuration |

**Why `intel/` is gitignored by default:** competitive intelligence is classified
`sensitive` — local-LLM-only, never cloud. Committing it would expose it to anyone
with repo access. Users who want it versioned can remove `intel/` from `.gitignore`
but must ensure the repo is private and collaborators are trusted.

**Why `active/` is gitignored by default:** pre-launch creative can contain
confidential messaging, pricing strategy, and embargoed product details.
Committed draft creative has leaked campaign strategy in real incidents.
Promoting to `launched/` on campaign go-live is the explicit versioning step.

## .gitignore Rules

The provisioner writes two sets of rules:

1. **`_campaigns/.gitignore`** — ignores `intel/`, `active/`, and `index/` within
   the campaigns root. `lib/`, `launched/`, and `_config/` are NOT ignored.

2. **Repo root `.gitignore`** — appends a `# campaigns-plane-rules` block with
   `_campaigns/intel/`, `_campaigns/active/`, `_campaigns/index/` for belt-and-
   suspenders coverage.

## Campaign ID Scheme

Campaign IDs are human-chosen slugs (kebab-case). Convention: `<YYYY-QQ>-<descriptor>`
or `<channel>-<descriptor>`.

Examples: `2026-q2-brand-awareness`, `instagram-summer-launch`, `email-newsletter-may`

Phase 2 (t2963) adds sequential IDs via counter, analogous to the case ID scheme.
Phase 1 supports free-form slugs provisioned by the user.

## Sensitivity Tiers

| Folder | Default tier | LLM access | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `intel/` | `sensitive` | Local only | Competitive intel — hard-fail if no local LLM |
| `active/` | `internal` | Cloud OK | Pre-launch creative — confidential but not privileged |
| `lib/` | `internal` | Cloud OK | Reusable assets |
| `launched/` | `public` | Any | Post-launch work is typically public |
| `_config/` | `internal` | Cloud OK | Plane config |

Sensitivity tiers map to the broader sensitivity layer defined in `knowledge-plane.md`.
When the sensitivity classifier (t2846) is active, it stamps each file's metadata.

## `_config/campaigns.json` Defaults

Written at provision time from `.agents/templates/campaigns-config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "campaign_id_prefix": "camp",
  "sensitivity": {
    "intel": "sensitive",
    "active": "internal",
    "lib": "internal",
    "launched": "public"
  },
  "llm_policy": {
    "intel": "local-only",
    "active": "cloud-ok",
    "lib": "cloud-ok",
    "launched": "cloud-ok"
  },
  "blob_threshold_bytes": 31457280,
  "swipe_auto_tag": true,
  "cross_plane": {
    "feedback_source": "_feedback/",
    "knowledge_promotion_path": "_knowledge/insights/marketing/",
    "performance_path": "_performance/marketing/"
  }
}
```

Override per-repo by editing `_campaigns/_config/campaigns.json` after provisioning.

## CLI Reference

Provisioning commands: `campaigns-provision-helper.sh`. Route via `aidevops campaign <subcommand>`.

```bash
# Provision _campaigns/ in current repo
aidevops campaign init [<repo-path>]

# Re-provision / repair (idempotent)
aidevops campaign provision [<repo-path>]

# Show provisioning state and campaign counts
aidevops campaign status [<repo-path>]

# List campaigns (active + launched)
aidevops campaign ls [--active|--launched|--all] [<repo-path>]
```

**Phase 2 CLI (t2963):** `campaign new`, `campaign list`,
`campaign launch`, `campaign archive`, and sequential campaign IDs.

**Phase 5 CLI (t2967):** `campaign draft <id> --channel <ch> [--tone <tone>] [--variant N]`
— AI creative agent for channel-aware content drafting. RAG-grounded in `lib/brand/`
(voice/tone) and `lib/swipe/` (inspiration). Output: `active/<id>/drafts/<channel>-v<N>.md`
with provenance metadata. Human-gated: drafts require manual review before promotion.
Channel specs: `.agents/configs/campaign-channel-specs.json`.

**Phase 6 CLI (t2969):** `campaign launch`, `campaign promote`,
`campaign feedback` — cross-plane promotion of results and learnings.

## CAMPAIGNS.md Contract File

Written to `_campaigns/CAMPAIGNS.md` at provision time. Describes the directory
layout to any collaborator or AI agent encountering the directory for the first time.
It is the user-facing equivalent of this framework doc.

## Cross-Plane Connections

| Direction | Connection |
|-----------|-----------|
| `_feedback/ → _campaigns/active/<id>/research/` | Audience pain/insight pulled into campaign research |
| `_campaigns/launched/<id>/learnings.md → _knowledge/insights/marketing/` | Post-mortem learnings promoted |
| `_campaigns/launched/<id>/results.md → _performance/marketing/` | Metrics pushed to performance plane |
| `_inbox/ → _campaigns/lib/swipe/` | Triage routes campaign-relevant captures (ads, inspiration) |

Promotion is handled by `campaign-helper.sh promote` (t2969). Integration with
`_feedback/` is handled by `campaign-helper.sh feedback` (t2969).

## Dependencies

- **Provisioning:** independent — can provision without t2840 foundation
- **Sensitivity enforcement:** requires t2846 (sensitivity detector) for automatic classification
- **Intel LLM policy:** requires t2848 (Ollama substrate) for local-only enforcement
- **Post-launch promotion:** requires `_knowledge/` and `_performance/` planes (t2843, future)
- **Swipe routing from inbox:** requires `_inbox/` plane (t2866)

## Helper

`.agents/scripts/campaigns-provision-helper.sh` — provisioning and introspection.
