**Creating reports**: When a user asks to create a report, client audit, evidence-led PDF, board pack, scorecard, or report preview, read `reports/general.md` first, then the matching domain report doc and `reports/exporters.md`. Keep `report.md` or `report.json` canonical; use `/report-render` only for derived HTML/PDF output.

**Creating report agents**: When a report will repeat, read `reports/routine-handoff.md` and `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md`. Deterministic collection belongs in `run:` steps; `agent:Reports` owns evidence interpretation, narrative, recommendations, and handoff tasks.

**Creating agents**: When a user asks to create, build, or design an agent — regardless of which primary agent is active — always read `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md` first. It contains the tier prompt (draft/custom/shared), design checklist, and lifecycle rules.
