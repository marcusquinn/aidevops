# Domain Index

Read subagents on-demand when trigger words clearly match. Full index: `subagent-index.toon`.

This index describes what is catalogued, not what is usable now. Query `scripts/capability-readiness-helper.py query [capability] --runtime <runtime>` and gate routing with its `route` command. Canonical machine-readable definitions and generated counts are in `configs/capability-registry.json` and `reference/capability-registry.md`.

## View boundaries

- `subagent-index.toon` owns primary-agent registration. Its broad triggers choose a coordinator; they do not establish a user-intent route or service readiness.
- This file owns user-intent entry points. Keep one row per domain, retain compatible aliases in a single row, and use the most specific domain before its primary-agent coordinator.
- `configs/capability-registry.json` owns executable readiness. `reference/capability-registry.md` is generated from it; catalogued or installed metadata never authorizes a provider action.

**Creating reports**: When a user asks to create a report, client audit, evidence-led PDF, board pack, scorecard, or report preview, read `reports/general.md` first, then the matching domain report doc and `reports/exporters.md`. Keep `report.md` or `report.json` canonical; use `/report-render` only for derived HTML/PDF output.

**Creating report agents**: When a report will repeat, read `reports/routine-handoff.md` and `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md`. Deterministic collection belongs in `run:` steps; `agent:Reports` owns evidence interpretation, narrative, recommendations, and handoff tasks.

**Creating agents**: When a user asks to create, build, or design an agent — regardless of which primary agent is active — always read `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md` first. It contains the tier prompt (draft/custom/shared), design checklist, and lifecycle rules.

**Routine feature verification**: Keep ordinary “verify/prove this works” requests with Build+ and `reference/ci-gate-policy.md`; they do not trigger testing-infrastructure setup. Load `tools/build-agent/agent-testing.md` only for explicit agent-behaviour testing.
