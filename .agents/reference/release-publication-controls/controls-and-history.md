# Release Publication Controls

This reference is the impact matrix and rollout boundary for repository release
settings. Code hardening and live-setting mutation are separate checkpoints.
Changing repository, environment, npm, or tag-policy settings requires explicit
maintainer operation approval after this matrix has been reviewed.

## Code-enforced provenance

The canonical release path records these trailers in a signed annotated tag:

- `Aidevops-Version`
- `Aidevops-Source-PR`
- `Aidevops-Source-Merge`
- repeated `Aidevops-Aggregated-Source` entries when a reviewed aggregation PR
  replaces one or more earlier authorized sources

`.agents/scripts/release-provenance-helper.sh` verifies the same evidence before
GitHub release creation, npm OIDC publication, and Homebrew update work:

1. tag, `VERSION`, `package.json`, checkout, and bump-commit subject agree;
2. the local and GitHub tag-object SHA agree, and the annotated tag is
   GitHub-verified and points at the checked-out commit;
3. the tag commit is reachable from `origin/main`;
4. the recorded source PR is merged into `main`, its merge SHA matches, and that
   merge is the direct parent of the release commit.

### Intervening-main recovery

A source merged to the default branch is eligible for the next authorized
release, but if it is no longer the direct `main` tip, provenance requires a new
reviewed aggregation PR at the exact release tip. Its immutable message records:

```text
Aidevops-Release-Aggregator-PR: <aggregation-pr>
Aidevops-Release-Aggregates: <authorized-pr>@<merge-sha>
```

Repeat `Aidevops-Release-Aggregates` for every otherwise-unreleased merged source
settled by the release. The release helper verifies the aggregation PR and every listed PR
against GitHub, requires their exact merge SHAs to be ancestors of the aggregate
tip, and copies the complete manifest into the signed tag. An intervening direct
commit without this reviewed attestation remains blocked.

The source resolver classifies an exact-tip aggregation PR as aggregate even
when the caller names that aggregation PR rather than one of its included
sources. This prevents the direct-source fast path from omitting the tag copy.
For an already-signed tag whose redundant aggregate entries are wholly absent,
recovery may reconstruct them only from the signed `Aidevops-Source-Merge` SHA
after validating the aggregator identity, complete commit manifest, and every
included PR. Any explicit partial, duplicate, malformed, or conflicting tag
manifest remains fail-closed. A recovery workflow executes this verifier from
its exact reviewed `main` workflow commit while all release artifacts remain
pinned to the immutable tag checkout.

After all publication and deployment gates succeed, the aggregation PR receives
`release:published`; each included PR receives `release:superseded` plus a JSON
receipt linking its merge SHA to the aggregation PR, release tag, and release
commit. A failed pre-publication attempt records both the requested and current
source SHAs as actionable failure evidence, but creates no tag or publication.
Retries reconcile terminal receipts and cannot publish twice.

### Post-publication supersession

A different recovery path applies when an older signed tag already published all
three package channels, exact-tag postflight dispatch was its sole failed step,
and a later independently authorized release has since become terminal. The old
tag cannot use normal recovery because GitHub, npm, and Homebrew now converge on
the newer version, and deploying its checkout would downgrade the runtime.

`aidevops release reconcile <older-source-pr>` may mark that receipt
`release:superseded` without publication or deployment only when it verifies:

1. the older tag's immutable source provenance and correlated workflow job;
2. successful GitHub release, npm, and Homebrew verification steps followed by
   one failed `Queue exact-tag postflight` step and no other failed step;
3. a strictly descendant latest signed tag with a terminal-success publication
   run and exact current channel convergence; and
4. a local `release:published` receipt for the latest tag's source PR.

The resulting `.successor.json` receipt records both source PRs, merge SHAs,
tags, release commits, and workflow run IDs with evidence type
`post-publication-supersession`. It is distinct from reviewed aggregation: the
newer tag does not retroactively claim an `Aidevops-Aggregated-Source` trailer.
Missing, duplicated, renamed, malformed, nonterminal, or conflicting evidence
fails closed and leaves the older receipt unchanged. `status` remains read-only,
and this path never dispatches publication or runs `post-release` from the stale
checkout.

The aggregation PR must expose a durable review record before merge. Create it
as a draft from an initial documentation commit, then add the allocated PR
number and every authorized `PR@MERGE_SHA` source in a follow-up commit without
rewriting the published branch. No earlier branch commit may contain a
recognized aggregation trailer. Only the final commit carries one contiguous
trailer block so the repository's squash message and
`git interpret-trailers --parse` expose exactly one aggregator identity and one
entry per source. After merge, verify the parsed squash message and run the
source resolver against the exact `origin/main` tip before publication.

If `main` advances while that PR is in review or CI, do not rewrite its branch
or reuse its allocated identity. Run `aidevops release refresh-aggregate
<stale-aggregation-pr>`. The release-lane compare-and-swap transaction converges
retries on one draft successor at the new exact tip, allocates that PR number
before writing its sole trailer commit, and leaves review and merge explicit.
Another `main` advance repeats this successor transition rather than weakening
the exact-tip fence.

PR #28725 demonstrated the fail-closed duplicate-trailer case: its squash
message retained an earlier separated trailer block plus the final contiguous
block. No release was attempted from that ambiguous manifest; a new reviewed
single-block aggregation supersedes it. PR #28727 then demonstrated the
terminal-receipt guard then in force: publication was rejected because its
manifest included PR #28720, which already recorded `release:not-requested`.
That receipt is now defined as "no immediate publication" rather than permanent
exclusion, so a later explicitly authorized release may transition it before
publication. Published and superseded receipts remain immutable. PR #28729
records the historical recovery under the former rule.

## Actions default-permission impact matrix

Repository default permissions can move from `write` to `read` only after every
workflow declares its needs. The repository audit found eight callers without an
explicit `permissions` block; the merged code-hardening checkpoint made all eight
explicit.

| Workflow | Required permission | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `update-website-docs.yml` | `contents: read` | Reads this repository; its separate website PAT owns the external write. |
| `plugin-import-check.yml` | `contents: read` | Read-only pull-request validation. |
| `counter-monotonic.yml` | `contents: read` | Reads Git history and `.task-counter`. |
| `markdoc-validate.yml` | `contents: read` | Read-only schema validation. |
| `version-validation.yml` | `contents: read` | Reads versions and existing tags. |
| `task-id-collision-check.yml` | `contents: read`, `pull-requests: read` | Reads commit history and PR metadata. |
| `review-bot-gate.yml` | `contents: read`, `pull-requests: read`, `statuses: write` | Matches the reusable gate contract and publishes its status. |
| `issue-sync.yml` | `actions: read`, `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Union required by its job-scoped reusable workflow permissions. |

Existing workflows with explicit job or workflow permissions retain their
current least-privilege declarations. No workflow was found that requires the
repository setting allowing GitHub Actions to approve pull-request reviews; the
setting can be disabled after the read-default change is verified.

## Live rollout checkpoint

Apply these operations only through an audited, explicitly approved settings
session. Do not create a release, package, deployment, or test tag as validation.

### Pre-mutation state and rollback matrix

Read-only inventory on 2026-07-27 captured the original exposure immediately
before mutation. The approved rollout completed later that day: API-visible
controls passed the read-only verifier, the unsupported GitHub and npm settings
were captured before and after through their UIs, and PR #28722 merged only after
the protected environment existed. Preserve the private machine-readable
snapshot captured by `release-publication-settings-helper.sh snapshot` as the
rollback source; do not reconstruct rollback values from this summary.

| Control | Pre-mutation state | Approved target | Exact rollback input |
|---|---|---|---|
| Actions defaults | `default_workflow_permissions=write`; workflow PR approval enabled | `read`; PR approval disabled | Restore both values from `actions.workflow_permissions` in the snapshot. |
| Actions policy | Actions enabled; all actions allowed | No change in this checkpoint | Preserve `actions.policy` unchanged. |
| Workflow permissions | All 55 workflows declare `permissions`; the eight previous default-dependent callers are listed above | Keep every declaration explicit | Revert code normally; do not compensate by restoring broad defaults. |
| Release tag rules | No repository rulesets | One active tag ruleset named `Protect aidevops release tags`; exact `refs/tags/v*` include with no exclusions; creation, update, and deletion restrictions only; one specific release-author user as the only bypass | Delete only the created ruleset by its response ID; never delete or replace unrelated rulesets. |
| Environments | No environments | Protected `release` environment; initially one release-author reviewer and selected tag policy `v*`; the approved unattended successor has no reviewer/wait timer and exact deployment policies for tag `v*` plus branch `main` recovery | Delete only the created environment if the snapshot proves it did not exist; otherwise restore the captured detail and policies. |
| npm Trusted Publisher | Existing GitHub Actions publisher; environment binding must be checked in npmjs.com | `marcusquinn/aidevops`, `publish-packages.yml`, environment `release`, `npm publish` only | Restore the exact pre-change publisher fields captured in the npm UI; npm exposes no supported management API for this configuration. |

### Initial activated state

The verified live state after the rollout is:

- Actions defaults are read-only and workflow-authored pull-request approval is
  disabled; the repository Actions policy remains otherwise unchanged.
- `Protect aidevops release tags` is active for exact `refs/tags/v*` creation,
  update, and deletion, with `marcusquinn` as its sole user bypass.
- `release` requires `marcusquinn`, permits self-review, disallows administrator
  bypass, and accepts only the `v*` tag deployment policy.
- npm Trusted Publisher is bound to `marcusquinn/aidevops`,
  `publish-packages.yml`, environment `release`, with `npm publish` allowed and
  staged publication disabled.

No tag, release, package, deployment, or Homebrew update was created to validate
the rollout. Any subsequent publication still requires separate explicit release
intent and the canonical full-loop release path.

The release-author identity is a consequential live-policy choice and is not
guessed here. The current GitHub REST schema explicitly supports a `User`
repository-ruleset bypass actor on personal repositories, so the approved release
author can be the single bypass principal rather than granting bypass to an entire
repository role.

### Unattended successor state

Issue #28737 replaces the initial per-run confirmation gate after production
evidence showed that a protected workflow could outlive the 30-minute local
waiter, leaving false `release:failed` evidence, and that a GitHub release created
with `GITHUB_TOKEN` did not trigger the package workflow. Manual approval by the
same release-author identity was confirmation, not independent review, and is not
a durable authorization boundary.

After the issue #28737 code checkpoint merges, the approved live target is:

- keep the protected `v*` tag ruleset and its single release-author bypass;
- keep npm Trusted Publisher bound to `publish-packages.yml` and `release`;
- remove required reviewers and wait timers from `release`;
- permit exactly `v*` tag deployments and `main` branch recovery deployments;
- keep environment administrator bypass disabled and re-check it in the UI.

The trusted operator's complete expected source set is the publication
authorization input. The runner resolves every explicitly authorized PR to its
merged `main` SHA, normalizes and persists the resulting `PR@SHA` set before any
version mutation, and reuses that exact set on retry. Git ancestry proves code
presence only; it never adds authority. The observed direct or reviewed aggregate
manifest must equal the expected set exactly, so omissions, extras, duplicates,
malformed entries, or SHA mismatches fail before a version bump, tag, package, or
receipt mutation. Calls without an explicit set retain singleton compatibility by
using the requested source PR as the expected set.

After that equality gate, the signed annotated tag becomes the durable
publication record. Before any public side effect, one unified workflow verifies
its exact source PR/merge trailers, GitHub-verified tag object, release commit,
and `main` ancestry. A normal
tag run must execute at the matching tag ref. Recovery must execute the reviewed
workflow from `main`, accepts only the newest exact semantic-version tag, and
repeats the same provenance verifier. GitHub release creation, npm publication,
and Homebrew update are each check-before-write and verify-after-write operations,
so retries converge without duplicate publication or channel downgrade.

Immutable historical tags are never rewritten to repair an authorization gap.
Detached `authorization-gap` evidence records the expected and observed source
sets, tag object, release commit, timestamp, and reason. It is deliberately not a
release status or cleanup receipt, cannot transition cleanup to terminal success,
and cannot authorize publication. Omitted source receipts remain pending until
separately reviewed terminal evidence exists.

This unified path supersedes the interim separate package dispatch. Workflow-run
discovery binds a push to the exact tag commit. Recovery names and verifies an
exact `<tag-commit>.<main-workflow-commit>` correlation: the dispatcher supplies
the verified tag commit and the run identity appends GitHub's actual workflow
commit. This avoids branch-advance races, rejects unavailable or malformed API
responses, and never treats uncertainty as successful correlation.
npm registry uncertainty likewise fails closed before publication. Existing and
new npm versions must match the exact locally packed integrity and shasum; npm's
signature audit must then verify one SLSA provenance statement binding that digest
to this repository and workflow path at either the exact tag ref or reviewed
`main` recovery ref. This preserves recovery after npm succeeds in a tag run but a
later channel fails. Homebrew reconciliation
compares the complete expected formula from the signed tag rather than accepting
matching URL or digest fragments in otherwise drifted content.

The local initiator observes only that the exact tag workflow was queued; it does
not have to remain alive until publication completes. Exit `8` means durable
pending work, not failure. Resume from any trusted session with:

```bash
aidevops release status <source-pr>
aidevops release reconcile <source-pr>
```

`status` is read-only. `reconcile` verifies the newest matching signed tag and
channel state, dispatches recovery only when no successful run has converged, and
finalizes release receipts/local deployment only after GitHub, npm, and Homebrew
agree. Routine interactive publication does not use `sudo`. For a future
headless worker release, `sudo aidevops approve issue <issue> <owner/repo>` may
mint the existing root-signed issue authorization; it does not itself publish and
does not relax the trusted high/critical-priority release gate.

The GitHub snapshot and verifier are read-only:

```bash
snapshot_dir="${AIDEVOPS_TEMP_DIR:-$HOME/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/tmp}"
.agents/scripts/release-publication-settings-helper.sh snapshot \
  --repo marcusquinn/aidevops \
  --output "${snapshot_dir}/release-publication-settings-before.json"

.agents/scripts/release-publication-settings-helper.sh verify-github \
  --repo marcusquinn/aidevops \
  --release-author '<approved-login>' \
  --unattended
```

`verify-github` reports two UI checks because GitHub's environment API omits the
admin-bypass toggle and npm exposes Trusted Publisher management only in package
settings. Capture both values before and after mutation; exact field review is
the terminal non-publishing evidence because test publication is forbidden.

### Mutation order

1. Confirm the code-hardening and explicit-permission checkpoint, PR #28642, is
   merged. Re-run actionlint and required CI for the separate environment-binding
   checkpoint, PR #28722, but keep PR #28722 unmerged until step 8.
2. Capture the GitHub snapshot and npm publisher fields, record the ruleset and
   environment deletion rollback, and verify fresh operation approval.
3. Create the protected `v*` tag ruleset with one specific release-author bypass.
4. Create the `release` environment with the approved release author as its sole
   reviewer, self-review allowed, admin bypass disabled, and the selected `v*` tag
   policy before merging workflows that reference it. Otherwise a workflow run
   can implicitly create an unprotected environment.
5. Bind npm Trusted Publisher to `publish-packages.yml`, environment `release`, and
   the `npm publish` action. Do not enable staged or broader actions in this scope.
6. Set default Actions workflow permissions to read and disable workflow-authored
   pull-request approval. Verify required non-release workflows still receive
   their declared permissions.
7. Run the read-only GitHub verifier and compare npm UI fields to the recorded
   values. Negative verification uses fixtures only; do not create a tag, release,
   package, Homebrew update, or deployment.
   Any API assertion or UI comparison mismatch is a hard stop: do not merge, apply
   the captured rollback inputs, and investigate before taking a new snapshot and
   requesting approval again.
8. Merge environment-binding checkpoint PR #28722 only after the live `release`
   environment is protected and verification passes. That checkpoint binds the
   GitHub release, npm, and Homebrew jobs to `environment: release`.

Rollback restores only values captured in the pre-mutation matrix. Code changes
are reverted normally; live settings are never guessed or broadly reset.
