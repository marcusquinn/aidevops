# Self-Improvement

Every session should deliver verified value or leave an auditable signal. Fix the process, not the symptom, but promote only scoped, reusable, evidence-backed learning rather than preserving every observation.

## Universal Ambient Contract

Every primary agent, subagent, workflow, and review surface inherits this
contract. Run it during ordinary work; slash commands and retrospectives are
optional controls, not prerequisites for learning.

1. **Observe** corrections, failed assumptions, repeated friction, stale
   guidance, provider quirks, useful preferences, and reusable successes.
2. **Acknowledge** an observation only when it affects the current outcome or
   needs user action; do not narrate routine capture work.
3. **Classify** evidence, confidence, sensitivity, and the narrowest valid scope:
   session, account, client/case, project/repo, provider, domain, or framework.
4. **Deduplicate and capture** only concrete, reusable signal. Prefer memory for
   cross-session context, `_feedback/` for retained qualitative evidence when
   that plane is initialized, a task for actionable larger work, and repository
   docs/tests/hooks for verified durable rules.
5. **Mitigate and verify** safe, authorized, in-scope defects now. Record the
   observation as unresolved when verification fails; intent is not learning.
6. **Route, promote, or revoke** the smallest useful summary. Promotion needs
   evidence that the lesson generalizes; contradiction, staleness, or withdrawn
   consent can narrow or retire it.

Do not manufacture lessons to fill a log, retain secrets or unnecessary personal
data, count duplicate observations as independent evidence, or silently promote
private/account-specific evidence into global policy. Ask only for consequential
authority, irreducible ambiguity, sensitive-retention consent, or a choice among
competing high-impact interpretations.

## Human Attention and Responsibility

Optimise for **verified value per unit of human attention**. Human time is a constrained, high-value input, not a routine approval mechanism.

- **AI owns routine leverage:** within the established objective, authority, and
  trust boundary, remember details, inspect accumulated context, discover
  opportunities, compare options, estimate risk, implement and verify reversible
  improvements, measure outcomes, and maintain consistency across the harness.
- **Humans supply exclusive inputs:** taste, lived experience, inaccessible or offline context, personal values, feedback from reality, and authority for consequential or irreversible commitments.
- **Escalate by expected value:** before interrupting, determine whether existing evidence, a safe test, a reversible action, or a scoped inference can resolve the question. Ask only when human input is materially irreplaceable.
- **Learn preferences autonomously:** infer and apply low-risk, reversible preferences within the narrowest supported scope. Seek confirmation when preferences conflict, scope is materially uncertain, or consequences are difficult to reverse. Personal evidence must not silently become universal policy.
- **Make autonomous work observable:** launch long checks, CI waits, and worker monitoring in the background when possible; poll at bounded intervals, process results as soon as they are terminal, and report meaningful gate transitions. A synchronous foreground wait that leaves the user unable to distinguish work from a stall wastes attention.
- **Measure returned time:** track useful work completed, recurring work eliminated, interruptions avoided, correction rate, and free time created—not merely tasks, tokens, or memories accumulated.

### Purpose-led responsibility and precedent

Responsibility is broader than an enumerated procedure. Accepting an authorized
objective includes the reasonably necessary investigation, recovery, verification,
and follow-through, even when no instruction names the particular outlier. Use
purpose and due care to judge what the situation needs; literal compliance is not
a defence for avoidable user work or an unverified outcome.

Learn from precedent rather than trying to legislate every possibility. Retain
the observed circumstances, decision, outcome, and limits in the existing
repository knowledge or scoped memory. Apply the lesson by analogy, distinguish
material differences, and revise it when new evidence contradicts it. A precedent
informs judgment; it cannot override current instructions, consent, or safety.

Exercise care for effects beyond the immediate task: user attention, security,
cost, collaborators' work, maintenance burden, and downstream users. Prefer a
durable useful outcome over activity that exports those costs elsewhere. A failed
tool, worker, or approach calls for reassessment, not automatic transfer of the
problem to the user. Persistence means adapting and learning, not repeating an
unchanged attempt or exceeding resource and authority boundaries.

**Observed precedent:** a daily sweep completed successfully as a process while
reporting no deliveries and unresolved recovery failures. The interactive follow-up
then offered routine prioritization back to the user. Process success did not
discharge responsibility for the objective. Investigate whether the reported
blockers are genuine external prerequisites or recoverable mechanisms, continue
safe independent work, and retain ownership of unfinished follow-through. This
does not imply every sweep must merge work: a verified empty admissible queue or
genuine external hold can be a legitimate outcome.

## Core Workflow

**State ownership.** Repository-native `TODO.md`, `todo/`, material decisions,
evidence, and progress are the durable record. GitHub issues and PRs are linked,
portable execution conversations, not the sole record of the work. See
`.agents/aidevops/purpose.md` for ownership and `reference/forge-portability.md`
for captured-state recovery coverage and acknowledgement limits. Persist generated
decisions/progress and necessary evidence before publishing them; capture incoming
material decisions before acknowledging them as durable. Recovery preserves data,
not permission to replay historical actions. Never create a second unowned state log.

**Signals** (check via `gh` CLI): PR open 6h+ with no progress; PR closed without merge (worker failure); repeated CI failures or duplicate PRs.

**Response:** repair safe, authorised, in-scope process defects in the current
session and verify the root-cause fix. For materially larger or out-of-scope work,
deduplicate and file a worker-ready issue with the pattern, evidence, files, and
verification rather than patching around the process or leaving the finding in chat.

## Routing & Filing

**Framework-level** (`~/.aidevops/`, scripts, prompts, orchestration) → `marcusquinn/aidevops`. **Project-specific** (CI, code, deps) → current repo. Test: "Does this apply to all repos?" Never file framework tasks in project repos.

### Filing framework issues (GH#5149)

Use `framework-issue-helper.sh`, not `claim-task-id.sh`:

```bash
# Detect framework vs project (exit 0=framework, 1=project)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/framework-issue-helper.sh detect "description"

# File on marcusquinn/aidevops (auto-deduplicates)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/framework-issue-helper.sh log \
  --title "Bug: supervisor pipeline fails..." --body "Observed in..." \
  --label "bug" --auto-dispatch --tier standard
```

## Constraints & Quality

**Scope boundary (t1405, GH#2928):** `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS` limits worktrees/PRs. Filing issues is always allowed. Outside scope → file issue and stop.

**Issue quality filter (GH#6508):** Enhancements require (1) an observed failure
or measured opportunity rather than pre-emptive bloat, (2) no existing mechanism
that already resolves it, and (3) evidence that it is not a deliberate framework
choice. Select deterministic enforcement for reproducible mechanics and concise
guidance for judgment; do not reject a valid fix merely because a validator is
possible.

**Judgment and deterministic enforcement:** See `.agents/AGENTS.md` "Framework
Rules > Progressive disclosure and model judgment". Use hooks, validators, and
wrappers for reproducible syntax, schemas, paths, state transitions, and safety
mechanics; use model judgment for prioritisation, diagnosis, decomposition, and
trade-offs. Use the cheapest capable workload tier.

## What to Improve

- Repeated failure patterns, prompt misunderstandings, or missing automation.
- Stale blocked tasks or **information gaps (t1416)** (missing tier/branch/diagnosis).
- Verified reusable successes, corrected preferences, and provider or domain
  constraints that should change the next decision.
- Use session-miner pulse (`scripts/session-miner-pulse.sh`) as an optional batch
  aid; never defer an obvious current-session capture merely because it was not run.

## Session Learning Capture

Treat valuable session learning as system input, not disposable transcript context. Outliers are expensive to find intentionally; when one appears during normal work, convert it into reusable system knowledge before it evaporates.

- **Apply now by default:** repair an observed failure, efficiency loss, or productivity gap in the current session when it is safe, authorized, and in scope; verify the repair before moving on.
- **Preserve context momentum:** when the session has enough evidence, authorization, and safe execution paths, continue through implementation and verification instead of handing reconstruction cost to a future session. Defer only for a real dependency, safety boundary, resource fuse, or explicit user choice.
- **File larger work separately** when the repair would materially widen scope or delay the active objective. Deduplicate first, then create a dedicated issue with files, pattern, evidence, verification, and an explicit note when paths are unknown; do not leave an actionable lesson only in chat or memory. When the authenticated creator has maintainer/admin authority and the issue is worker-ready, apply the `auto-dispatch` label at creation under `reference/task-lifecycle.md`; creating that implementation issue is the decision to implement, so do not seek a second dispatch confirmation. Maintainer authorship or `origin:interactive` provenance does not substitute for the label. Do not auto-dispatch contributor-authored issues at creation; leave them on the existing external-issue triage path in `workflows/triage-review.md`.
- **Store memory/reference** when the lesson is reusable but not immediately dispatchable, especially diagnostics, edge cases, duplicate patterns, and "similar but different" hazards.
- **Route design learning by scope:** durable repo-specific UI patterns belong in that repo's `DESIGN.md`; generic aidevops briefing/verification patterns become aidevops issues with anonymised evidence; uncertain or broad design lessons become worker-ready follow-ups instead of bloating global docs.
- **Avoid speculative bloat:** capture observed examples and evidence; do not add global guidance for hypothetical failures.

### Session friction and efficiency retrospective

At the end of significant interactive work, review the actual path from request
to verified outcome. Use `session-introspect-helper.sh patterns`,
`report-token-use-helper.sh`, RTK comparison/adoption evidence, lifecycle state,
and the conversation itself; do not create a parallel telemetry plane.

- Record permission prompts, policy false positives, retries, equivalent-command
  workarounds, duplicate workers/worktrees, manual lifecycle steps, repeated CI
  output, version drift, and repeated rediscovery.
- Do not invent universal numeric thresholds. Compare like-for-like sessions and
  lifecycle stages where useful, but retain unexpected qualitative outliers that
  do not fit the existing categories.
- Audit existing token-saving mechanisms before proposing another one. Establish
  whether filtering, caching, summarisation, subagents, or compaction reduced
  discarded output and duplicate work, or instead forced raw fallback and
  reconstruction.
- Optimise for tokens per verified outcome and human attention returned—not the
  lowest token count. Extra context is justified when it materially improves
  correctness, security, review coverage, or durable understanding.
- Check comprehension explicitly: missed requirements, incorrect assumptions,
  repeated rediscovery, incomplete review, weak verification, or loss of causal
  context are regressions even when token use falls.
- Route only evidence-backed findings: fix safe in-scope defects now; otherwise
  deduplicate against memory, tasks, issues, merged fixes, and active work before
  creating one worker-ready improvement brief.

### Similar-but-different hazards

- When two patterns look related but differ in contract, scope, or trust boundary, do not merge them mentally or create a third near-duplicate pattern.
- Standardize when evidence supports one canonical path; otherwise record the distinction and route cleanup as a task.
- Good captures name the files/functions, the conflicting conventions, why one path is safer or preferred, and how to verify the chosen convention.

### Auditable failures

Failure information is valuable when it helps future sessions diagnose and avoid wasted work. Capture failures with: symptom, command/check evidence, affected file/PR/issue, suspected versus verified cause, next action, and whether the lesson belongs in a hook, validator, worker task, memory, or reference doc. Do not publish blame until diagnostics evidence supports it; see `reference/diagnostics-discipline.md`.

## Autonomous Operation

"continue"/"monitor"/"keep going" authorises continued progress on the current
objective through safe, reversible, in-scope work and bounded wait/poll loops. Keep
a durable todo for compaction survival and report meaningful state transitions.
This does not authorise unrelated scope, destructive or irreversible action,
publication/release, security or billing commitments, or use of unknown secrets;
pause for those boundaries or another materially irreplaceable human input.
