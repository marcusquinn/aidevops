# Agent Routing

## Core rule

Dispatch issue-backed workers with `dispatch-single-issue-helper.sh dispatch NUMBER OWNER/REPO`. It performs deduplication and ownership ceremony, creates the worktree, and forwards the verified runner identity to `headless-runtime-helper.sh`. Use `headless-runtime-helper.sh run` directly only for non-issue headless jobs. Never use bare runtime CLIs: they skip lifecycle reinforcement and can stop after PR creation (GH#5096).

Capability cataloguing is not evidence of live usability. Before routing execution that depends on an external tool or service, run `scripts/capability-readiness-helper.py route <capability> --runtime <opencode|claude-code>`. Mandatory dimensions that are false **or unknown** force the declared fallback; the structured response reports the reason and coverage impact. The canonical contract is `configs/capability-registry.json`; generated inventory: `reference/capability-registry.md`.

Conceptual comparison using supplied information needs no service probe. Select
domain knowledge without claiming installed, authenticated or authorized access.
Before the first provider-dependent action (including a live read), load the
owning service instructions and check readiness and task authority. A transition
from discussion to execution reactivates this gate; conceptual routing is not an
execution exemption. If the helper, runtime coverage or required evidence is
unavailable, do not guess readiness or substitute a provider call: use the
declared fallback, or remain conceptual and report the unavailable capability.

## View ownership

- `subagent-index.toon` is the primary-registration view: it maps broad triggers to a coordinator and is not a readiness claim.
- `reference/domain-index.md` is the user-intent view: it selects the narrowest entry point, including Accounting for bookkeeping, invoices, receipts, and reconciliation. Business remains the company-operations coordinator.
- `configs/capability-registry.json` is the executable-readiness view: its generated inventory is `reference/capability-registry.md`, and it gates provider actions only. Registration and intent matching never imply installed, authenticated, or authorized access.

Every selected agent inherits the ambient improvement contract in
`reference/self-improvement.md`. Commands may expose controls, but routing must
not depend on a user remembering to request learning or feedback capture.

## Routing order

1. Read the task or issue description.
2. If it is clearly code work (`implement`, `fix`, `refactor`, `CI`), use Build+ or omit `--agent`.
3. Resolve a narrow user-intent match through `reference/domain-index.md` before using a broad primary-agent trigger. Select knowledge without service probes for conceptual work; before provider-dependent execution, apply the Core rule readiness gate above. Execute only when every mandatory dimension is true and task authority permits it; otherwise use the reported fallback.
4. If uncertain, default to Build+; it can load narrower docs on demand.
5. **Bundle-aware routing (t1364.6):** project bundles can define `agent_routing` overrides. Check with `bundle-helper.sh get agent_routing <repo-path>`. An explicit `--agent` flag wins.

The selected agent changes the system prompt and domain knowledge loaded for the worker.

## Interactive subagent progress

- Use subagents for independent advisory work, not the implementation critical path. The sole default execution exception is the post-merge local standard-tier release handoff in `workflows/release.md`; it preserves primary ownership and publication authority, not general worker dispatch.
- Dispatch at most two children in one batch and do not launch another batch until they return.
- Prefix every delegated prompt with `[effort:simple]`, `[effort:standard]`, or `[effort:thinking]`; use the lowest tier that can reliably complete the task.
- Use `simple` only for bounded, low-consequence advisory work with objective parent-verifiable evidence. The parent must validate the result; fluent output alone is not successful completion.
- A thinking-tier parent does not require thinking-tier children. When reliable, offload bounded, independent, output-heavy discovery, analysis, and tool work to simple or standard children; keep small low-output calls direct when delegation overhead outweighs context savings.
- Batch independent children in one parallel call. Require final-only summaries with the decision, evidence (paths/lines or commands), uncertainty, and next action; raw logs stay in child context and the parent owns synthesis.
- Keep the parent progressing on non-overlapping work. Do not finalize with children pending; use their returned evidence or complete the work locally and disregard late results.
- Subagents must not dispatch further subagents. OpenCode clamps configured child reasoning to the parent's known effort only for the exact same model. Different models retain their tier's reasoning: effort names are not comparable compute budgets across models. A medium parent does not globally cap children at medium.
- In interactive OpenCode sessions, an eligible child can end with the exact marker `BLOCKED: capability limit - <evidence>`. The plugin re-prompts that same child session at the next configured tier so prior evidence is retained. Generic blockers, headless dispatch, terminal tiers, and children that attempted side effects never take this automatic path.
- For full-loop work, persist stable unit IDs, dependencies, explicit file/question ownership, effort tier, and a reuse key before dispatch. Parallel-ready units must have disjoint file ownership; overlap is serialized even when capacity is available.
- Effective concurrency is the minimum of the plan cap, mode cap, and available global slots. Interactive batches remain capped at two; headless uses its configured per-task cap.
- Persist completed-unit evidence and reuse it after retries or runtime interruption. The primary repeats delegated exploration only when its evidence is absent, stale, or contradictory.
- Consolidate adversarial review into bounded correctness/concurrency, security/trust, compatibility/quality, and test-adequacy units, followed by one synthesis and one repair pass.

### Focused domain delegation (OpenCode native Task)

`domain-focused` and `domain-light` are two bounded execution roles, not another
registry of domain prompts. Build+ remains the normal systems/development parent.
Use these roles for independent advisory inference over **supplied** evidence:
neither has tools, network access, mutation authority, recursion, or automatic
capability escalation. The parent retains task ownership and validates the result.

Pass a JSON envelope as the Task prompt (an optional leading effort marker is
accepted). For example, Build+ can independently ask `domain-focused` to analyse
supplied campaign evidence, then use `domain-light` for a narrower arithmetic check:

```json
{
  "task": "campaign-rate-review",
  "objective": "Compare the supplied conversion rates without causal claims",
  "scope": "Only these two observations; no campaign changes",
  "source": "marketing-sales.md",
  "decisions": "No publishing, spending, discovery or claims of significance",
  "evidence": "A: 20 conversions / 1000 visits. B: 30 / 1000 visits.",
  "output": "Return task ID, rates with evidence citations, uncertainty and next action",
  "tools": [],
  "authority": "inference-only",
  "effort": "standard"
}
```

For the light task, narrow the objective to arithmetic and select `effort: simple`.
Expected parent-verifiable evidence is 2% versus 3%, a 1 percentage-point difference;
these counts alone do not establish causality. Host completion is not acceptance.
Return missing evidence/capability as unavailable and cancellation as cancelled.

Canonical identity reuses the t18405 primary-delivery contract: only a configured
primary whose resolved prompt equals its canonical source is eligible. The focused
role receives that source's body; the light role receives its authored
`AI-CONTEXT-START` section only. Both retain the framework core and child authority
contract. Source hashes are rechecked at dispatch, leaf pointers are not followed,
and no parent transcript or repo content is loaded automatically. Supply any
essential decisions or additional domain evidence in the envelope; if a required
section is absent, use the focused role rather than claiming the light role read it.

The exact parent model is inherited. Focused reasoning is capped at medium (low for
simple requests), light reasoning at low, and both are clamped to the observed
parent variant. Unknown parent model/variant, changed model, missing source, source
drift or malformed envelope fails closed. These are reasoning ceilings, not claims
of exact token/cost caps. No provider fallback or escalation can enlarge the bound.
Cancellation and cleanup stay with the existing native Task owner; no new process,
MCP connection, or external resource is created by profile generation.

Only the OpenCode plugin config/native Task chat adapter changes. Generated
OpenCode primary files, Claude Code discovery, Codex and headless launch adapters
are unchanged; unsupported runtimes retain the existing `research-only`/inference
delegation path with explicitly supplied canonical sources. Do not assume these
two names are available there. Registration is additive and idempotent, preserves
user-owned name collisions, and stores source identities per plugin instance, not
in a global repository cache. Disable either generated profile with a user-owned
`disable: true` override; restart OpenCode after changing configuration.

### Improve efficiency during ordinary work

Optimise verified completion per allowance window and human attention, not minimum
tokens per call. Choose pragmatic, reversible routes using the task, current
pricing and available outcomes; a separate benchmark project is not a prerequisite.
Keep workload tier, concrete model and reasoning effort distinct; current defaults
and estimate limitations live in `tools/context/model-routing.md`.

- Delegate when a child can discard substantial irrelevant material or investigate an independent question. Use tools directly for deterministic answers or small results already needed by the parent; do not buy a second opinion merely for reassurance.
- Supply the question, narrow source scope, acceptance evidence and stop condition rather than the whole parent transcript. Request a few hundred words when sufficient; summary length and advisory output limits do not cap hidden reasoning or total work.
- Keep every applicable safety, authority and domain instruction in that scope. Optimise relevance and duplicate loading, not guidance quality. The inference-only `ai-research` tool requires source context through `files`/`agents`; a path in its question alone does not grant repository access. Use a tool-capable research profile for discovery.
- Count child context, tools, reasoning, parent integration and repair in the outcome. Validate the evidence without repeating the investigation. Missing context calls for better context; repeated capability failure calls for a stronger route, not a tour through every effort level.
- Reuse existing routing feedback, checks and concrete repair evidence. Distinguish host completion from verified acceptance. Repeated repair justifies raising that task class's route; repeated easy verified success supports a lower-effort choice. Record reusable lessons through the existing self-improvement workflow, not a new dashboard or per-task ceremony.
- Preserve permission, trust, locality, billing and side-effect boundaries. Safe task-level choices remain autonomous; persistent shared defaults use the normal reviewed change/release path. Interrupt the user only for authority or a consequential trade-off, and keep delivery moving.

### Specialist advice without promoting the parent

Start with the cheapest credible model and reasoning level, not the largest model
associated with a domain label. The OpenAI daily driver and thinking route use Sol
medium; simple and standard children use Luna low and Terra low. Pulse and worker
parents can use the same advisory pattern as interactive parents without allowing
children to recurse or expanding the worker's dispatched scope.

Use `specialist-advisor` (OpenCode native Task) only for a concrete capability gap,
a genuinely difficult specialist decision, or an explicit request for escalation.
Candidates include original UI/UX design, deep domain synthesis, non-obvious
security/concurrency/performance analysis, and complex 3D geometry. These are
judgment triggers, not automatic promotions: routine CSS, scanner output, measured
hotspot collection, and established modelling operations stay on cheaper routes.

The separately configured `specialist_advisor` route defaults to Astra low. It is
not a fourth tier, not an availability fallback, and not an automatic continuation
of a Sol session. `domain-focused` and `domain-light` still inherit the exact parent
model and cannot be used to request Astra from Sol. `ai-research` accepts canonical
tiers only, so `thinking` means Sol, not this specialist route.

Pass a JSON prompt (optionally prefixed `[effort:thinking]`):

```json
{
  "objective": "Resolve the remaining concurrency risk",
  "scope": "Advisory analysis of this transaction only; no execution or delegation",
  "evidence": "Supply relevant code, observed failure, attempted fix, domain and safety constraints here",
  "escalation_reason": "The cheaper analysis failed the supplied interleaving check; isolate the unresolved ordering decision",
  "output": "Return a proposed invariant, cited evidence, uncertainties and a parent-verifiable check in 500 words"
}
```

Collect evidence cheaply first. Supply essential excerpts, domain guidance and
acceptance criteria—not the entire session or paths alone. The tool-free child
cannot inspect a UI, browse, run an audit, create a 3D artifact or verify its own
proposal. The parent performs those operations using the actual domain tools.
Validate once against the acceptance criteria and integrate the answer; do not
automatically purchase another review. A tool error, missing source, authentication,
rate limit, permission or privacy restriction requires repair of that cause, not
a larger model. No automatic reasoning ladder is shipped for Sol or Astra.
Raise specialist reasoning only when explicitly requested or evidenced necessary;
otherwise repair context or stop after a bounded unsuccessful advisory attempt.

The profile is available to OpenCode interactive and headless parents after
restart; unsupported runtimes must not pretend it exists. Honour local-only,
provider and billing constraints before delegating. A missing/disabled profile is
unavailable; never silently switch providers or start an external worker instead.
Existing user model/variant pins and custom routing remain explicit overrides.

Routing boundary: SEO owns search-demand evidence, query provenance, keyword
metrics, and intent/trend interpretation. Research owns the wider market and
competitor synthesis, Content owns topic production, and PR owns current-story
verification, newsworthiness, standing, and journalist-facing action. Hand off
the intent ledger; do not move adjacent-domain judgment into SEO.

For narrower domains such as Reports, App Stack, WordPress, Shopify, Cloudflare, Proxmox, Remotion, CalDAV, public relations, or browser/mobile work, read `reference/domain-index.md` and the relevant skill/subagent entry before defaulting to Build+. For repeatable browser operations or web data mining, route through `/auto-browse` and `.agents/workflows/auto-browse.md` so profile state, safety gates, and private/shareable artifact boundaries are handled consistently.

Product-facing copy such as websites, campaigns, customer email, social posts, and marketing or introductory sections uses `content/humanise.md` by default before delivery. Ordinary replies, engineering documentation, reports, issues, and PRs use the plain-language baseline in `AGENTS.md`; do not load Humanise unless the user explicitly requests it or the passage itself is product copy. An explicit `/humanise` request remains valid for any supplied prose.

## Report routing

Use `agent:Reports` and `reports/general.md` when the task asks for a report, client audit, evidence-led PDF, scorecard, board pack, report preview, source ledger, or recurring report agent. Keep domain collection with the relevant primary/domain agent, then hand the evidence bundle to Reports for structure, citations, recommendations, and export contracts.

For new report agents, read `reports/routine-handoff.md` and `tools/build-agent/build-agent.md`: deterministic collection goes in `run:` steps; `agent:Reports` handles interpretation and narrative; `/report-render` or `scripts/commands/report-render.md` creates derived HTML/PDF previews from canonical `report.md` or `report.json`.
