# Tabby profiles

Use `.agents/scripts/tabby-profile-sync.py` to generate aidevops project profiles
from `repos.json`. When `~/.buzz` exists, setup/update also generates a `Buzz`
profile rooted there so OpenCode opens the Buzz-scoped session namespace. The
profile is omitted when Buzz has not created that workspace, and an existing
profile with the same working directory remains user-owned and unchanged.

`tabby-helper.sh status` reports pending reconciliation without changing the
configuration. `tabby-helper.sh sync`, including the setup/update path, removes
only profiles confidently identified as aidevops-generated when their cwd is
both missing and unregistered, or when a later managed profile duplicates an
earlier managed profile's normalized cwd. It preserves custom profiles,
custom/managed same-cwd pairs, existing unregistered profiles, and missing paths
still registered in `repos.json`. The validated write is atomic and a second
sync must be a no-op. Sync also self-repairs the narrowly identified legacy
corruption where generated list entries were appended beneath `profiles: []`.
Other invalid YAML remains unchanged and fails visibly.

OpenCode profiles must not launch with `zsh -i -c opencode`. That shape runs an
interactive zsh startup while executing a command string, which can make
Powerlevel10k/gitstatus initialize before job control is available and emit
errors such as `setopt: can't change option: monitor` or `gitstatus failed to
initialize` before the TUI starts.

Do not use `TABBY_AUTORUN=opencode` for generated profiles. It depends on a
`.zshrc` startup hook and can fail silently, leaving users in a plain shell.

Do not put `/bin/zsh -l -c 'opencode; exec zsh'` in Tabby's `command` field.
Tabby expects `command` to be the executable path and shell flags to be separate
`args`; using the whole command string can make profile launches fail.

Tabby's command-line editor parses unquoted shell operators (`&&`, `;`, `>`,
and similar) into object-valued arguments. Its PTY launcher accepts only string
arguments, so such a saved profile can leave the Tabby renderer unresponsive.
For a custom command containing operators, paste the complete quoted invocation
`<login-shell> -l -c '<command>'` into the combined command-line field. Do not paste
only the inner command. `tabby-helper.sh status` reports profiles containing
non-string arguments and exits nonzero; repair them before launch.

The safe generated shape is:

```yaml
command: /absolute/path/to/login-shell
args:
  - '-l'
  - '-c'
  - 'exec aidevops opencode --tabby-shell'
env: {}
```

`--tabby-shell` enables exact crash restoration for managed profiles. The
OpenCode plugin creates a private marker for the root session and reports that
marker as Tabby's current directory with `OSC 1337`. When Tabby restores the
tab, the launcher validates marker ownership and permissions, isolated-storage
containment, the session ID, original directory, and the matching SQLite row
before running `opencode --session <id>`. Invalid markers fail closed. A normal
OpenCode exit returns to the same resolved login shell in the original project
directory. Resolution accepts only an absolute executable POSIX shell, prefers
`AIDEVOPS_TABBY_LOGIN_SHELL`, the configured `SHELL`, and the account login
shell, then uses deterministic platform fallbacks (`/bin/zsh` first on macOS,
`/bin/bash` first elsewhere). Sync fails visibly if no safe shell is available.

Tabby stores a snapshot of each recovered tab's profile command. Tabs saved
before the managed profile migration may therefore keep launching plain
`aidevops opencode` even after `config.yaml` contains `--tabby-shell`. The
launcher detects Tabby's `TERM_PROGRAM` and config-directory environment in
isolated mode and implicitly enables the same recovery path, allowing those
stale recovery tokens to self-heal after one launch.

Recovery markers live under
`~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/work/opencode-tabby-recovery/`. They contain only
the OpenCode session ID and local directory references, use owner-only
permissions, and are inert unless Tabby starts the launcher from that exact
marker directory.

For manual one-off profiles that should run OpenCode and then leave a shell open,
use the same non-interactive login command instead of mixing `-i` and `-c`:

```yaml
command: /absolute/path/to/login-shell
args:
  - '-l'
  - '-c'
  - 'exec aidevops opencode --tabby-shell'
```
