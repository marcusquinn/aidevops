# Review Bot Add-on Policy (t1382, GH#3827, GH#17541)

**Permanent default:** required project CI controls merge readiness. Code-quality
add-ons such as CodeRabbit and Gemini are advisory: absent, pending, unavailable,
rate-limited, or late results never delay a trusted maintainer-controlled PR.
Late feedback is swept after merge and filed as worker-ready follow-up issues.

Repositories with an exceptional sensitivity requirement may explicitly opt into
review-before-merge with `review_gate.completion_behavior: strict`. Strict is
never the framework default. Mirror strict CI intent with the repository Actions
variable `AIDEVOPS_REVIEW_GATE_COMPLETION_BEHAVIOR=strict`. The GH#17671
external-contributor trust boundary remains fail-closed independently.

## Enforcement Layers

1. **CI**: `.github/workflows/review-bot-gate.yml` may remain a required compatibility
   status, but default missing/late review emits `PASS_ADVISORY` and succeeds. It
   blocks for missing completion only under explicit strict policy or the external
   trust boundary.
2. **Pulse merge path**: `review-bot-gate-helper.sh status-json` supplies typed,
   exact-head evidence. `PASS_ADVISORY` is valid only for trusted authors.
3. **Worker merge path**: `full-loop-helper.sh merge` accepts the same default
   advisory outcome after required CI succeeds.
4. **Branch protection**: a required `review-bot-gate` context is compatible with
   this policy because it reports success for advisory outcomes.

All layers share the same `review-bot-gate-helper.sh` implementation — the settlement
check and completion behaviour are consistent across CI and in-agent merge paths (GH#20493).

## Merge Commands

| Context | Command | Gate |
|---------|---------|------|
| Worker (full-loop) | `full-loop-helper.sh merge <PR> [REPO]` | Advisory by default; strict opt-in blocks |
| Pulse (deterministic) | Internal `_merge_ready_prs_for_repo` | Typed advisory/strict evidence |
| Manual (interactive) | `review-bot-gate-helper.sh check <PR> [REPO]` | Read available feedback without default delay |

Workers MUST use `full-loop-helper.sh merge` — direct `gh pr merge` bypasses the gate (GH#17541).

## Workflow

- Before merging, run `review-bot-gate-helper.sh check <PR_NUMBER>` to collect
  available feedback. Default no-response output is `PASS_ADVISORY`, not `WAITING`.
- `WAITING` means the repository explicitly selected strict/wait behavior or the
  external-contributor trust boundary applies.
- `skip-review-gate` remains an auditable internal exception for strict setups;
  default advisory repositories do not need it.
- ALWAYS read bot reviews that are available before merging. Address critical/security findings; note non-critical suggestions for follow-up.
- `PASS_ADVISORY` means no completed add-on review was required under the permanent
  default. `PASS_RATE_LIMITED` is the narrower true-rate-limit outcome. Both
  delegate late feedback to the post-merge scanner for trusted exact-head PRs.
  API-exhausted runs do not retry immediately. External/unknown authors and
  explicit `wait` or `strict` policies remain fail-closed.
- When many PRs are rate-limited simultaneously, use `request-retry` on the highest-priority PRs first. Stagger retries to avoid re-triggering rate limits.

## Additive suggestion decision tree

When a review bot comments with a suggestion that isn't a correctness issue in the PR's own code:

1. **Is the suggestion a correctness fix for code introduced by this PR?**
   - Yes → expand the PR, add a commit, re-request review.
   - No → go to 2.

2. **Is the suggestion adding coverage, generality, new behaviour, or cosmetic improvements?**
   - Yes → file as follow-up task with `ref:GH#<current-PR>`.
   - No → skip (may be a nit; see the `coderabbit-nits-ok` rule in AGENTS.md "Review Bot Gate").

3. **File follow-up via:**
   - Claim task ID (`claim-task-id.sh`).
   - Write brief in the current planning worktree.
   - File issue with worker-ready body + `Source: review comment on PR #<N> by @<bot>` citation.

### Example

PR #19712 (t2209) Gemini review suggested extending the duplicate-ID regex to cover declined tasks and routine IDs. This is additive (broader coverage), not a correctness fix for the PR's shipped behaviour. Filed as t2222 / #19723.

See also: AGENTS.md "Review Bot Gate (t1382)" for the authoritative rule and rationale.

The same follow-up pattern applies to advisory CI: slow E2E, visual, performance,
or integration checks that are not required for the target branch should file
worker-ready follow-up tasks unless they prove a defect introduced by the PR.
See `ci-gate-policy.md`.

## Composition with auto-merge paths

The review add-on check runs after the `origin:interactive` (t2411) and
`origin:worker` worker-briefed (t2449) gates. This means:

- **Default trusted PRs**: `PASS_ADVISORY` clears the add-on check once required
  project CI and independent trust gates pass; bot response time is irrelevant.
- **Strict repositories**: `completion_behavior: strict` requires settled review
  evidence. `min_edit_lag_seconds` still protects CodeRabbit's two-phase pattern.
- **External contributors**: advisory, rate-limit, and skip outcomes remain
  fail-closed; completed review evidence is required in addition to independent
  maintainer/cryptographic authority.

The helper is still evaluated and audited on every merge path; advisory is an
explicit successful policy outcome, not a bypass. Draft, `hold-for-review`, human
`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, required CI, exact-head, and maintainer gates remain independent.
