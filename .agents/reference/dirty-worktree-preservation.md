# Dirty Canonical Worktree Preservation

Use when a canonical checkout contains unexpected tracked, staged, untracked,
or local-commit state. Canonical checkouts are read-only service mirrors on any
branch name; implementation sessions belong in linked worktrees.

## Safety rule

Do not stash, reset, clean, or include unexpected files in another PR. Process
cwd does not make a canonical checkout session-owned. Preserve and verify every
byte before removing only the matching state.

## Preserve without mutation

```bash
.agents/scripts/dirty-worktree-backup-helper.sh backup \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --reason "unexpected canonical mirror state" \
  --issue <issue-if-known> \
  --task <task-id-if-known>
```

The backup command does not mutate the checkout. It records the original HEAD,
index tree, full worktree tree, status fingerprint, binary patches, copied
untracked files, and stable `refs/aidevops/dirty-worktree-backups/<id>` commits.
It prints the backup ID and exact restore command. Use `verify` and `matches`
before any explicit `clean` operation.

## Audited mirror synchronization

An explicit request to synchronize the canonical mirror authorizes this route:

```bash
.agents/scripts/canonical-recovery-helper.sh sync-mirror \
  --repo /path/to/canonical-checkout \
  --issue 123 \
  --confirm SYNCHRONIZE_CANONICAL_MIRROR
```

The helper structurally refuses linked worktrees. It resolves the allowed branch
from registered repository config, committed `HEAD:.aidevops.json`, or
`origin/HEAD`; an untracked/modified project config and arbitrary `--branch`
cannot select the target. Under the canonical recovery lock it:

1. fetches and pins the exact allowed `origin/<branch>` tip;
2. creates and verifies a lossless backup before cleaning matching noise;
3. removes only structurally canonical ownership rows without signalling PIDs;
4. preserves divergent/local-only commits at an audited recovery ref;
5. compare-and-swaps the local ref and updates the worktree to the pinned tip;
6. verifies branch, HEAD, remote ref, worktree cleanliness, and the audit chain.

If synchronization stops after cleanup, the old ref remains unchanged and the
printed backup ID/restore command remains valid. Retry the same command: stable
operation IDs reuse matching evidence rather than overwriting it. A failed
compare-and-swap rolls the local ref back. Never bypass the helper with direct
`git pull`, reset, or clean.

## Converged stale rebase recovery

When a clean canonical checkout has completed an interactive rebase but stale
metadata still blocks `restore-default`, use the separately confirmed cleanup:

```bash
.agents/scripts/canonical-recovery-helper.sh clear-stale-rebase \
  --repo /path/to/canonical-checkout \
  --issue 123 \
  --confirm CLEAR_CONVERGED_STALE_REBASE
```

Under the canonical recovery lock, the helper fetches and pins the configured
default branch, verifies the audit chain, and requires `HEAD`, the local default
ref, and the pinned remote tip to be identical. It accepts only a completed,
clean, structurally valid `rebase-merge` state for that default branch. Active,
dirty, divergent, branch-mismatched, malformed, or changing state fails closed.

Before cleanup, the helper copies and fingerprints all rebase metadata under
`~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/recovery/canonical/` and creates durable
`refs/aidevops/canonical-recovery/issue-<N>/stale-rebase/<sha>` refs for commit
IDs found in that metadata. It then proves cleanup did not change HEAD, local or
remote refs, the index tree, or worktree content. Run `restore-default` with its
own confirmation token after this command succeeds. Never use direct
`git rebase --quit`, reset, clean, or metadata deletion on a canonical checkout.

## Abandoned active rebase recovery

Use the distinct abandoned-state operation only when a clean canonical mirror
is detached at the pinned remote default tip but old interactive-rebase markers
still describe an incomplete stopped sequence:

```bash
.agents/scripts/canonical-recovery-helper.sh clear-abandoned-rebase \
  --repo /path/to/canonical-checkout \
  --issue 123 \
  --confirm CLEAR_ABANDONED_STALE_REBASE
```

This command does not relax `clear-stale-rebase`. It requires complete stopped
`rebase-merge` metadata for the configured default branch, a matching
`REBASE_HEAD` and `stopped-sha`, metadata whose newest marker is at least 24
hours old, HEAD at the exact pinned remote tip and beyond the stopped commit,
and a local default ref that remains an ancestor of that tip. Fresh, attached,
dirty, divergent, malformed, ambiguous, or changing state fails closed.

Before removal, the helper copies and fingerprints the complete metadata plus
`REBASE_HEAD`. It resolves full or abbreviated commit IDs from todo, done,
backup, stopped, and rewritten metadata and creates durable issue-scoped refs
for every reference. After a final HEAD/ref/index/worktree check, it
compare-deletes only the expected `REBASE_HEAD`, quarantines the metadata,
re-fingerprints the quarantined snapshot, and restores it if concurrent state
appears. After success, run the separately confirmed `restore-default`
operation to attach and fast-forward the configured default branch. Never
substitute `git rebase --quit` or manual `.git` deletion.

Restore preserved state only to a clean checkout on the recorded branch:

```bash
.agents/scripts/dirty-worktree-backup-helper.sh restore \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --backup <backup-id> \
  --confirm RESTORE_DIRTY_WORKTREE_BACKUP
```

## Backup retention

Backups live under:

```text
~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/tmp/dirty-main-backups/
```

Open backups are never pruned automatically, including when a linked PR closes.
Only explicitly acknowledged or restored evidence becomes eligible for terminal
PR/age pruning. Use `.keep` inside a backup directory for indefinite retention.

Manual prune:

```bash
.agents/scripts/dirty-worktree-backup-helper.sh prune --dry-run
.agents/scripts/dirty-worktree-backup-helper.sh acknowledge \
  --backup <backup-id> --confirm ACKNOWLEDGE_DIRTY_WORKTREE_BACKUP
.agents/scripts/dirty-worktree-backup-helper.sh prune --force
```
