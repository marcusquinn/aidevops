# Routines Reference

Recurring operational jobs live in `TODO.md` under `## Routines`. Git-tracked, `r`-prefixed IDs distinguish them from one-off `t`-prefixed tasks. Use `/routine` to design, dry-run, and install recurring scheduler entries.

Route by trigger:

- Recurring calendar work → `/routine` and a `repeat:` definition in `TODO.md`
- One delayed execution → `aidevops schedule once`; private state lives outside Git
- Condition-driven queue work → Pulse, not a fake calendar interval

One-shot jobs accept either an exact UTC `--at` timestamp or a relative
`--after` duration. `aidevops schedule status [JOB_ID]` reports the lifecycle,
and `aidevops schedule cancel JOB_ID` cancels work that has not started. The
versioned state machine is `queued → claimed → running →
success|failure|cancelled`. A single platform scheduler calls `run-due`, so
queued jobs survive reboot without one service or sleeper per job. Prompt
material, dispatch paths, and logs remain private with restrictive modes.

## Format

```markdown
## Routines

- [x] r001 Weekly SEO rankings export repeat:weekly(mon@09:00) ~30m run:custom/scripts/seo-export.sh
- [x] r002 Daily health check repeat:daily(@06:00) timezone:UTC ~2m run:custom/scripts/health-check.sh
- [ ] r003 Monthly content calendar review repeat:monthly(1@09:00) ~15m agent:Content
- [x] r004 Nightly repo triage repeat:cron(15 2 * * *) ~20m agent:Build+
```

Pulse reads routine definitions from exactly one top-level `## Routines`
section in each `TODO.md`. Fenced code, HTML comments, indented Markdown code,
and all other sections are documentation only. A `TODO.md` with no registry and
no routine-shaped lines simply has no routines: Pulse skips it silently. A
duplicate canonical heading, routine-shaped lines (`- [x] rNNN ... repeat:`)
outside any registry, or an unclosed fence/comment that makes the boundaries
ambiguous fails closed: Pulse dispatches no routines from that file and records
a local diagnostic.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[x]` / `[ ]` | Enabled / disabled (keep disabled entries for auditability) |
| `r001` / `r-name` | Stable `r`-prefixed ID — never reuse |
| `repeat:` | Recurrence expression (see below) |
| `timezone:` | Optional per-routine IANA timezone token, such as `UTC`, `Europe/Jersey`, or `Etc/GMT+1` |
| `~30m` | Expected runtime estimate |
| `run:` | Script path relative to `~/.aidevops/agents/` — deterministic, no LLM tokens |
| `agent:` | Agent name dispatched via `headless-runtime-helper.sh` |

## `repeat:` syntax

| Form | Example | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `daily(@HH:MM)` | `daily(@06:00)` | Every day at a fixed time |
| `weekly(day@HH:MM)` | `weekly(mon@09:00)` | Weekly on a named day |
| `monthly(N@HH:MM)` | `monthly(1@09:00)` | Day N of each month |
| `cron(expr)` | `cron(15 2 * * *)` | Complex schedules only |

Calendar expressions use this precedence: the routine's optional `timezone:`
field, global `AIDEVOPS_SCHEDULE_TIMEZONE`, the inherited `TZ`, then the host
timezone. A per-routine field therefore provides a version-controlled exception
without changing unrelated routines. For example:

```markdown
- [x] r005 UTC report repeat:daily(@00:30) timezone:UTC run:custom/scripts/report.sh
```

Timezone values are single IANA-style tokens; malformed fields fail closed
instead of falling back to the global or host timezone. `is-due` and `next-run`
use the same local-calendar boundaries: a run is due when its last
successful/terminal run predates the latest boundary.
This catches up missed slots and prevents an off-slot bootstrap or manual run from
suppressing the next boundary. Repeated fall-back hours belong to their first
occurrence; nonexistent spring-forward local times fail closed with a diagnostic.
Only successful runs advance `last_run`. Active runs remain blocked for up to six
hours, and failures retry after 15 minutes by default
(`AIDEVOPS_ROUTINE_FAILURE_RETRY_SECONDS`) rather than waiting a full period.
GitHub API cooldown exits are recorded as `deferred`, not `failure`. Their next
eligible attempt is persisted at the shared cooldown reset or `Retry-After`
boundary plus up to 60 seconds of deterministic jitter
(`AIDEVOPS_ROUTINE_COOLDOWN_JITTER_MAX_SECONDS`); Pulse does not sleep or launch
a long-lived retry process.

## Dispatch rules

1. `run:` present → execute script directly (deterministic-first)
2. `agent:` present → dispatch via `headless-runtime-helper.sh`
3. Both present → prefer `run:`
4. Neither → try `custom/scripts/{routine_id}.sh` (e.g. `r001.sh`), else `agent:Build+`

Use `run:` for scripts, exports, health checks. Use `agent:` when judgment or summarisation is needed.

## Scheduler ownership

Enabled `repeat:` routines in registered repositories are normally evaluated by
the shared supervisor Pulse. Their schedule definition and enabled state live in
the repository `TODO.md`; they do not receive a dedicated launchd or systemd unit.
Check the Pulse service plus the routine state file when diagnosing a missed run.

Only routines explicitly documented as persistent or externally scheduled use a
dedicated platform unit. Generated routine descriptions name that unit when one
exists; do not derive a service label from the routine title or ID.

Framework-managed routines have no `TODO.md` line; `pulse-routines.sh` evaluates
them through the same schedule, retry and REST-budget path:

| ID | Default schedule | Runs | Opt-out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `r-session-miner` | `daily(@04:40)` (`AIDEVOPS_SESSION_MINER_SCHEDULE`) | `session-miner-pulse.sh --create-issues` | — |
| `r-issue-archive` | `daily(@05:20)` (`AIDEVOPS_ISSUE_ARCHIVE_SCHEDULE`) | `issue-archive-helper.sh run` | host: `AIDEVOPS_ISSUE_ARCHIVE_ENABLED=0`; repo: `"issue_archive": false` in `repos.json` |

`r-issue-archive` archives issue/PR discussions of each pulse-enabled,
non-`local_only` registered repo to its orphan `aidevops/issues-archive` branch.
Enable it on one pulse host per repo so there is a single writer. Details:
`reference/forge-portability.md` "Issue and PR discussion archive".

## Anti-patterns

- Separate routine registry outside `TODO.md`
- Fake recurring entries or sleeping processes for one-shot work
- One-off task entries for routine execution history
- Running deterministic scripts through an LLM agent
- Schedule semantics outside version control
- Collapsing SOP, targets, and schedule into a single prompt — keep them independent

## Knowledge collector freshness (r047)

`r047` is a disabled, deterministic routine for configured folder, inbox-watch,
mailbox, and social sources. It does not launch an LLM or duplicate Pulse. A
private mode-0600 `knowledge-collectors.json` declares opaque connection IDs,
allowlisted connector IDs, source mode (`event`, `poll`, `watch`, `hybrid`,
`archive`, or `manual`), minimum/freshness/reconciliation intervals, bounded
runtime, installation-local arguments, and an explicit canonical
`projection_root` for active document collectors. Social collectors omit that
field because their transaction updates the social query index directly. Event notifications use a new opaque
`event_token` for each durable event; successful collection acknowledges that
token exactly once while the bounded reconciliation interval remains active.

Run `knowledge-collector-routine.sh plan` first. `run --dry-run` reports only due
opaque IDs; enabled execution is sequential, lease-protected by the state lock,
and invokes fixed local argv vectors without `eval`. Manual/archive sources are
reported as manual and are never polled. Event/hybrid sources reconcile on their
bounded interval. Poll/watch sources respect both useful freshness and a minimum
interval. Successful changed runs trigger incremental enrichment/indexing;
empty or failed runs do not.

Content-free owner-only health state records attempt/success/failure boundaries,
changed counts, projection status, next due state, rate-reset state, and
consecutive terminal failures. It never records account IDs, paths, filters,
arguments, provider output, or content. Alerts become eligible only after the
configured consecutive-failure threshold; pending, rate-reset, manual, and
disabled states are not terminal failures.

Operator-private setup:

1. Copy the schema from `test-knowledge-collector-routine.sh` into
   `~/.config/aidevops/knowledge-collectors.json`; keep mode `0600`.
2. Use only opaque connection IDs and local arguments; credentials remain in
   `aidevops secret`/provider profiles, never config arguments. Set
   `projection_root` to the exact existing `_knowledge` directory written by
   each non-social active collector; it is never inferred from the process
   working directory.
3. Run `plan`, then `run --dry-run`, inspect `health`, and execute one bounded
   manual `run` before enabling r047 in the installation's private override.
4. Keep the public repository definition disabled unless its checked-in config
   is intentionally installation-neutral.

## Runtime Health Audit (r-runtime-audit, t3072)

The supervisor LLM cycle triages GitHub state — issues, PRs, labels, scanner findings — but never inspects processes, logs, pulse-stats counters, or deployed-script mtimes. That gap is a structural blind spot: bugs visible to any operator running `ps`, `jq`, `tail` go unraised for hours.

`r-runtime-audit` runs a registry of small detectors against **local files only** — no GitHub API or GraphQL calls (which would amplify the blind spot many of the detectors surface). When a detector fires, the orchestrator either prints the finding (`--dry-run`, default) or files an issue tagged with `<!-- aidevops:generator=runtime-audit detector=<id> -->`. Findings are `auto-dispatch` only on the framework repo (`marcusquinn/aidevops`), whose worktrees contain the `.agents/scripts/` sources the briefs cite; `--apply --repo <other>` files operator-triage issues without `auto-dispatch` (GH#33574). The pre-dispatch validator re-runs the cited detector before any worker spawns, so transient regressions (the kind that resolve before a worker arrives) are auto-closed instead of consuming worker time.

### Detectors

| ID | Surfaces |
|----|----------|
| `counter-trend-delta` | 3x regression in any pulse-stats counter over the last 4h vs prior 4h |
| `process-count-anomaly` | More than 5 `pulse-wrapper.sh` processes (lifecycle reap leak) |
| `deployed-vs-source-mtime-drift` | Hot deployed script lags source by >24h (stale deploy) |
| `log-pattern-novelty` | New high-frequency log template absent from prior baseline |
| `idle-state-stuck` | `pulse.pid` shows `SETUP:<pid>` with a dead PID (lifecycle wedged) |

Each detector lives in `.agents/scripts/runtime-audit-rules/<id>.sh` as a self-contained file with `runtime_audit_id` + `runtime_audit_check` functions. To add a new detector, copy any existing rule file and add a fixture pair to `.agents/scripts/tests/test-runtime-audit-detectors.sh`.

### Operator workflow

1. **Dry-run first.** The routine ships **disabled** in `TODO.md` so the operator can review baseline noise: `runtime-health-audit-helper.sh --dry-run`.
2. **Tune thresholds.** Each detector has env-overridable inputs (e.g. `REGRESSION_MULT`, `LEAK_THRESHOLD`, `DRIFT_SECONDS`). If the dry-run flags benign conditions, raise the threshold or add the routine entry to `~/.aidevops/cron-overrides.conf` with custom env.
3. **Enable.** Flip the `[ ]` to `[x]` in the `## Routines` block once you're satisfied.
4. **Investigate findings.** Filed issues are real — they cite local files an operator can confirm in seconds. Close with rationale if benign; otherwise, on the framework repo, the issue body itself contains the worker-ready brief (file paths, verification commands, acceptance criteria) per t1900. Findings filed elsewhere are operator triage: confirm locally, then report upstream with `framework-issue-helper.sh log`.

### Anti-patterns specific to this routine

- **Adding a detector that calls `gh`, `curl`, or any network API.** The whole point is local-only inspection — network calls amplify the very blind spot we're closing.
- **Filing a finding without a marker.** The marker is what the pre-dispatch validator uses to re-check before dispatch. Without it, stale findings consume worker time.
- **Lowering thresholds to surface "everything".** Every false positive trains the operator to ignore the routine. Tune for high precision; the supervisor's task triage is the lower-precision layer.

## Pulse Check (r915)

`r915` runs `pulse-check-helper.sh apply` once daily. Unlike
`r-runtime-audit`, it is intentionally allowed to make bounded GitHub reads: its
job is to compare **current worker utilisation** with the **repos.json
auto-dispatch queue** and provider/API budget signals.

The helper is also the backing command for `/pulse-check` in interactive chats:

```bash
pulse-check-helper.sh report
pulse-check-helper.sh json
pulse-check-helper.sh apply --repo owner/repo
```

It gathers evidence from:

- `pulse-current-state-helper.sh --window 15m --json` for live dispatch,
  launch, guardrail, and API-budget state.
- `worker-activity-helper.sh summary --since 1h/24h --json --no-pr-check` for
  canonical recent and historical worker outcomes.
- A privacy-preserving aggregate scan of open `auto-dispatch` issues across
  pulse-enabled `repos.json` entries.

`apply` mode files only deduplicated self-improvement issues with the marker
`<!-- aidevops:generator=pulse-check finding=... -->`; issue bodies must stay
aggregate-only and must not include private repo names, local paths, issue
titles, or raw worker examples.

## Private mirror sync (r919)

Register private mirrors in `~/.config/aidevops/repos.json` under
`initialized_repos` with `slug` (the mirror's `owner/repo`) and
`mirror_upstream` (a string upstream `owner/repo`). Optional
`mirror_upstream_url` overrides the upstream fetch URL. Boolean
`mirror_upstream` is a privacy marker only and is not synchronised. Set
`"mirror_sync": false` on an entry to opt out.

When eligible entries exist, setup installs a daily 20:00 job with label
`sh.aidevops.mirror-sync` on macOS (or a systemd/cron equivalent on Linux).
`mirror-sync-helper.sh check [--repo owner/repo]` inspects without pushing;
`sync` fetches upstream and mirror in a disposable repository. It pushes only
to the private mirror: a pure mirror advances by fast-forward; divergence
creates a dated `sync/upstream-YYYYMMDD` branch and fast-forward pushes the
clean merge. Conflicts leave the default branch untouched and appear in
`mirror-sync-helper.sh status`. Neither force pushes, tags nor writes to the
upstream are performed. Mirror identities and conflict paths remain local;
do not copy them to public issues or TODOs.
