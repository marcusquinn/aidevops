# Override / Bypass Flag Reference

> **Context:** The t2377 data-loss bug (GH#19847) was caused by `FORCE_ENRICH=true`
> silently bypassing ALL content-preservation logic with no audit log, no rationale
> check, and no safety floor. This matrix catalogues every operator-facing bypass flag
> in the framework so the pattern is never repeated silently.
>
> **Columns:** Each flag is evaluated against four criteria from the issue rubric:
> - **Owner** — who/what sets this flag (operator, CI, auto-triggered script)
> - **Bypasses** — which specific checks or gates are skipped
> - **Logged?** — is there an `info_log`/`warn_log`/`print_warning` at the bypass site?
> - **Floor?** — is there a minimum invariant the bypass must still respect?
> - **Test coverage** — is the bypass path covered by a regression test?
>
> Discovery command:
> ```bash
> rg "FORCE_\w+|SKIP_\w+|OVERRIDE_\w+|BYPASS_\w+|AIDEVOPS_.*_DISABLE" \
>     .agents/scripts/ .agents/hooks/ -l
> ```

| `AIDEVOPS_BASH_REEXECED` | `shared-constants.sh:48,68` | Bash re-exec guard — prevents infinite re-exec loop when modern bash is found | ✅ Implicit: set before `exec`, cleared immediately on bash 4+ (t2201 — no log needed; this is anti-loop internal state, not an operator bypass) | ✅ The anti-loop property holds: flag is cleared on bash 4+, preventing double-guard fire | ✅ `test-bash-reexec-guard.sh` |
| `AIDEVOPS_HEADLESS` / `FULL_LOOP_HEADLESS` / `Claude_HEADLESS` / `GITHUB_ACTIONS` | multiple (pre-edit-check.sh, full-loop-helper.sh, interactive-session-helper.sh) | Mode-detection flags — enable headless-only code paths (e.g., main-branch allowlist for TODO.md). **Not bypass flags** — they activate, not disable, safety gates. | ✅ Each check site tests the env var and routes to different code path | ✅ Headless paths have their own gates (CI-authority rule, pre-edit allowlist) | ✅ `test-pulse-wrapper-headless-export.sh`, `test-stats-wrapper-headless-export.sh` |

## Scanner Configuration Flags (tuning, not bypasses)

| Flag | Owner file(s) | Bypasses | Logged? | Floor? | Test coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CONTENT_SCANNER_SKIP_PREFILTER` | `content-scanner-helper.sh:187` | Keyword pre-filter optimisation — when `true`, always proceeds to full scan (more thorough, not less) | ✅ Implicit: skip causes _more_ scanning, not less; no bypass log needed | ✅ By construction: disabling the pre-filter expands coverage | ❌ No dedicated test (optimisation flag, not safety flag) |

## Flags Safe by Construction (not bypass flags)

The following flags were found by the discovery command but are **not bypass flags** — they
are mode-detection signals, threshold tuning parameters, or CLI flags that select different
(but equivalent) code paths:

- `AIDEVOPS_AUTO_UPGRADE_BASH` — controls whether `bash-upgrade-helper.sh` installs/upgrades
  bash; `0` means "don't auto-install", not "bypass a safety check"
- `OVERRIDE_CONF` / `OVERRIDE_ENABLED` / `OVERRIDE_DEFAULT` — dispatch-override config keys
  (per-runner claim filtering); these are routing policy, not safety bypass
- `FORCE_AWK` / `NESTING_DEPTH_FORCE_AWK` — selects AWK backend instead of shfmt; both backends
  compute the same metric
- `FORCE_HOTFIX_BANNER` — forces hotfix banner display in update-check; CI/test helper
- `FORCE_PHASE2` — forces efficiency-analysis Phase 2 in `efficiency-analysis-runner.sh`; no
  safety gate is skipped
- `SKIP_COUNT` — skip-count argument in `verify-brief.sh`/`test-ocr-extraction-pipeline.sh`;
  internal function parameter, not a global bypass env var
- `SKIP_LABEL` — the string value of the `skip-review-gate` label in `review-bot-gate-helper.sh`;
  not an env var, it's a constant label name
- `SKIP_PATTERN` — `_LFG_SKIP_PATTERN` in `pulse-dispatch-large-file-gate.sh`; a regex constant
  for file extensions to exclude from large-file gate (lockfiles, JSON, YAML)
- `SKIP_FOR_REF` / `SKIP_RANGE` — test-internal variables in `test-pulse-auto-complete-keywords.sh`
- `SKIP_LIST` — list of MCP servers to skip in `mcp-register-claude.sh`; internal list variable
- `SD_SKIP_GITHUB` — stuck-detection-helper.sh GitHub-ops skip for offline testing ✅ logged
- `CB_SKIP_GITHUB` — circuit-breaker-helper.sh GitHub issue creation skip for testing ✅ logged

## Summary: Findings from t2377 Audit

### ❌ Logged → Fixed in this PR (t2377 audit, GH#20146)

The following bypass sites lacked an `info_log` call and were fixed:

1. `FORCE_ENRICH` in `issue-sync-helper.sh:988` — added `print_info` at the bypass entry point
2. `FORCE_PUSH` in `issue-sync-helper.sh:831` — added `print_info` when bypassing CI-only gate
3. `FORCE_CLOSE` in `issue-sync-helper.sh:526` — added `print_info` when bypassing evidence check
4. `AIDEVOPS_VM_SKIP_BUMP_VERIFY` in `version-manager-release.sh:86` — added `print_info` when skipping bump-commit verification
5. `SKIP_FRAMEWORK_ROUTING_CHECK` in `claim-task-id.sh:1329` — added `log_info` on early return
6. `AIDEVOPS_HEADLESS_SANDBOX_DISABLED` in `headless-runtime-helper.sh:473,573` — added `print_info` when falling back to bare timeout
7. `AIDEVOPS_SKIP_AUTO_CLAIM` in `worktree-helper.sh:587` — added `print_info` on skip
8. `CONTENT_SCANNER_SKIP_NORMALIZE` in `content-scanner-helper.sh:235` — added note that normalization was skipped

### ❌ Floor → Addressed

- `FORCE_PUSH`: no floor exists; documented in matrix that the single-task path (`push <task_id>`)
  is the safe alternative. A hard dedup floor would require a GitHub API round-trip per push, which
  conflicts with the offline-capable design. Accepted risk documented.
- All other flags: floors exist by construction (see matrix) or are safe-by-construction (scanner
  flags, mode flags).

### ❌ Test coverage → New tests added (GH#20146)

New regression tests in `.agents/scripts/tests/test-override-flags.sh`:

1. `FORCE_PUSH` bypass path — verifies `print_info` fires and bulk push proceeds
2. `FORCE_CLOSE` bypass path — verifies `print_info` fires and evidence check is skipped
3. `AIDEVOPS_VM_SKIP_BUMP_VERIFY` — verifies bypass log and that tag gate proceeds
4. `AIDEVOPS_HEADLESS_SANDBOX_DISABLED` — verifies log fires when sandbox is disabled
5. `SKIP_FRAMEWORK_ROUTING_CHECK` — verifies log fires and function returns 0

### No action needed

- `CONTENT_SCANNER_SKIP_PREFILTER` — disabling the pre-filter expands coverage (safer, not less safe)
- Headless mode flags (`AIDEVOPS_HEADLESS` etc.) — mode detection, not bypass flags
- `AIDEVOPS_BASH_REEXECED` — internal anti-loop guard; logs not needed (transparency is in the code)
- BUNDLE_SKIP_GATES — already logs each skipped gate by name
