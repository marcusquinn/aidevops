# Repository Organization

Keep canonical clones under a Git workspace, organized by repository owner rather
than technology. The default workspace is `~/Git`.

## Default clone locations

| Repository ownership | Default path |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Personal account | `~/Git/<repo>` |
| Organization or third party | `~/Git/<owner>/<repo>` |
| Local-only, legacy, or exceptional | Explicit `repos.json` path |

Examples:

```bash
gh repo clone personal-account/project ~/Git/project
gh repo clone example-org/service ~/Git/example-org/service
```

Normalize new owner directory names to lowercase. Repository names retain their
upstream spelling. Configure personal aliases per Git host in `repos.json`; do
not assume that one GitHub login is the user's identity on every host:

```json
{
  "git_parent_dirs": ["~/Git"],
  "personal_owners": {
    "github.com": ["personal-account"],
    "gitlab.example": ["work-alias"]
  }
}
```

An explicit `initialized_repos[].path` and `owner/repo` slug remain authoritative.
This preserves non-GitHub hosts, offline volumes, local-only repositories,
historic layouts, and deliberate exceptions.

## Discovery boundary

Repository scans inspect direct children and one owner-directory level. They
exclude `_worktrees`, `_archive`, other underscore/dot-prefixed operational
directories, linked worktrees, submodules, and repositories nested inside an
already detected repository. Scans never recurse to arbitrary depth.

## Worktrees

Create worktrees under `${AIDEVOPS_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR:-~/Git/_worktrees}`.
Root-level repositories use flat `<repo>-<branch-slug>` names; owner-nested
repositories use `<owner>-<repo>-<branch-slug>` to avoid collisions.
`worktree-helper.sh add <branch>` derives this path. Existing sibling worktrees
from older versions remain valid until cleanup removes them safely.

Examples:

| Canonical clone | Generated worktree example |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| `~/Git/project` | `~/Git/_worktrees/project-feature-change` |
| `~/Git/example-org/service` | `~/Git/_worktrees/example-org-service-feature-change` |

## Migration safety

Setup and update never move canonical repositories. Use a separate, reviewed
transaction:

```bash
aidevops repos migrate-layout plan --workspace ~/Git --output plan.json
aidevops repos migrate-layout apply --plan plan.json --confirm <plan-sha256>
aidevops repos migrate-layout status --receipt <receipt-id>
aidevops repos migrate-layout rollback --receipt <receipt-id> --confirm <receipt-sha256>
```

`plan` is non-mutating. It inventories dirty state, branches, stashes,
submodules, linked worktrees, registrations, local consumers, and collisions.
Its summary also reports active-path consumers and the exact confirmed apply
command to resume. When a source or destination is active, save a session
checkpoint with `/checkpoint`, exit every process using either path, restart
from outside both paths, and run that resume command. The migration does not
create compatibility symlinks for a live process.
Explicit `initialized_repos[].path` entries remain excluded unless planning uses
`--include-registered-paths`; that approval is recorded in the content-hashed
plan. Apply rechecks the complete before-state, rejects cross-device moves and
active-path ambiguity, moves one repository at a time, and writes owner-private
append-only receipts. Replaying apply resumes verified steps. Rollback requires
the latest receipt hash and stops rather than overwriting post-plan changes.

Non-GitHub, local-only, unsupported, and already-conforming repositories are not
moved. Case-only and destination-inside-source moves use private same-filesystem
staging; destination collisions always fail closed.

## Direct-write workspace boundary

Direct file-mutation tools may write across repositories when both identities
resolve beneath `${AIDEVOPS_GIT_WORKSPACE_ROOT:-~/Git}` and the target is a linked
worktree. Canonical checkouts remain read-only regardless of their location.
Resolved worktree, Git directory, and common-directory paths must all remain
inside the workspace, so sibling-prefix paths and symlink escapes are denied.
Sanctioned outside-Git paths remain separate: a symlink traversed from inside a
Git worktree cannot use that allowance to escape the trusted workspace.
