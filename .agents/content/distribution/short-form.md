# Short-Form - TikTok, Reels, and Shorts Distribution

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Optimize content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts
- **Format**: 9:16 vertical video, 15-90 seconds, hook-first structure
- **Key Platforms**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat Spotlight
- **Success Metrics**: Completion rate, shares, saves, watch time

**Critical Rules**:

- **Hook in first 1-3 seconds** - Pattern interrupt or immediate value
- **Fast cuts** - 1-3 second shots maximum
- **9:16 aspect ratio** - Vertical video only
- **60s sweet spot** - Optimal length for all platforms (15-90s range)
- **Trending sounds** - Platform-specific audio trends
- **Captions required** - 80%+ watch without sound
- **No watermarks** - Cross-posting penalties on all platforms

**Platform-Specific Pacing**:

| Platform | Optimal Length | Cut Speed | Sound Strategy |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| TikTok | 15-60s | 1-2s cuts | Trending sounds critical |
| Reels | 30-60s | 2-3s cuts | Original audio + trending |
| Shorts | 30-60s | 2-3s cuts | Music library or original |
| Snapchat | 15-30s | 1-2s cuts | Original audio preferred |

**Content Type Presets**:

- **UGC-style** - 1-3s cuts, handheld feel, authentic voice
- **Educational** - 2-4s cuts, text overlays, clear narration
- **Entertainment** - 1-2s cuts, music-driven, visual hooks
- **Product showcase** - 2-3s cuts, benefit-focused, CTA at end

## Hook-First Structure

The first 1-3 seconds determine 80%+ of your completion rate.

**7 Hook Formulas** (from `content/story.md`):

1. **Bold Claim** - "This AI tool made me $10k in 3 days"
2. **Question** - "Why do 95% of AI influencers fail?"
3. **Story** - "I spent $5k on AI video tools. Here's what worked."
4. **Contrarian** - "Stop using ChatGPT for content creation"
5. **Result** - "From 0 to 100k followers in 30 days"
6. **Problem-Agitate** - "Your AI videos look fake. Here's why."
7. **Curiosity Gap** - "The AI video secret nobody talks about"

**Visual Hook Patterns**:

- **Extreme close-up** - Face, product, or detail shot
- **Unexpected action** - Pattern interrupt (drop, reveal, transformation)
- **Text overlay** - Bold statement in first frame
- **Before/After split** - Immediate contrast
- **POV shot** - First-person perspective

## Script Structure

**4-Part Framework** (adapted from `content/story.md`):

### 1. Hook (1-3 seconds)

- Visual + verbal pattern interrupt
- Text overlay with bold claim or question
- Immediate value promise

**Example**:

```text
[Visual: Extreme close-up of shocked face]
[Text: "I wasted $5k on AI tools"]
[Narration: "I spent five thousand dollars on AI video tools..."]
```

### 2. Storytelling (10-30 seconds)

- Before/During/After transformation arc
- Problem → failed solutions → discovery
- Personal story or case study
- Fast cuts (1-3s per shot)

**Example**:

```text
[Cut 1: Screen recording of failed AI output]
"...and 95% of them produced garbage."

[Cut 2: Montage of testing different tools]
"I tested 12 different platforms."

[Cut 3: Reveal of working output]
"Until I found this one trick."
```

### 3. Soft Sell (5-15 seconds)

- Solution reveal
- Benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
- Social proof or result
- Subtle CTA

**Example**:

```text
[Cut: Side-by-side before/after]
"Now I generate 10 videos per day that actually convert."

[Cut: Analytics screenshot]
"And my engagement went up 300%."
```

### 4. CTA (1-3 seconds)

- Follow for more
- Link in bio
- Comment keyword
- Save for later

**Example**:

```text
[Text overlay: "Follow for more AI tips"]
[Narration: "Follow for the full breakdown."]
```
