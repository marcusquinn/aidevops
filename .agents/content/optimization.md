# Content Optimization

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Optimize content via A/B testing, variant generation, and analytics-driven iteration
- **Input**: Published content, performance metrics, test hypotheses
- **Output**: Evidence-qualified variants, approval-bound recommendations, analytics insights
- **Related**: `content/production-*.md` (variants), `content/distribution-*.md` (platform metrics), `content/research.md` (next cycle)
- **Core rules**: Preregister before exposure | Verified control/assignment for causal claims | Respect sample/runtime/privacy/guardrails | Observations propose tests, not winners | Proven first, original second

## A/B Testing Discipline

### Planning Thresholds

These are channel heuristics for planning creative throughput. They do not
override the preregistered sample plan, fixed-horizon stopping rule, privacy
threshold, practical-effect threshold, or guardrails used to declare an
experiment result.

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Variants explored | 10+ | Build a sufficiently broad creative set |
| Sample size | 250+ | Planning floor; use the preregistered requirement |
| Performance | <2% | Low signal; diagnose before another test |
| Performance | 2-3% | Promising signal; validate in a controlled test |
| Performance | >3% | Strong signal; still require the evidence gates below |

**Platform minimums**: YouTube: 250 impressions, 2% CTR, 50% retention | TikTok: 500 views, 70% completion | Blog: 100 visitors, 2min+ avg | Email: 250 sends, 20% open | Thumbnail: 1000 impressions, 5% CTR

**Statistical planning default**: 95% confidence minimum; 7+ days for day-of-week
variance; 14+ days for audiences <1000. Record the exact alpha, power, baseline,
minimum detectable/practical effect, sample size, conversion minimum, and runtime
in the experiment definition before exposure.

### What to Test (priority order)

1. **Hooks** (first 3s / headline / thumbnail) — usually the highest-leverage early test
2. **Angles** (pain vs aspiration, contrarian vs consensus, before/after)
3. **Format** (long vs short, video vs text, listicle vs narrative)
4. **Thumbnails** (faces vs text, color, composition)
5. **CTAs** (placement, wording, urgency)
6. **Length** (word count, duration, scene count)
7. **Publishing time** (day, time)

**Hook types** (generate 5-10 per topic): Bold Claim, Question, Story, Contrarian, Result, Problem-Agitate, Curiosity Gap. Examples: "[Verified percentage] of [audience] hit [problem]" | "We tested [verified sample] — here's what worked" | "Why we stopped using [common approach] for [task]". Publish numbers only with source evidence.

**Thumbnail pipeline** (`thumbnail-helper.sh`):

```bash
thumbnail-helper.sh generate "Your Video Topic" --count 10 --template high-contrast-face
thumbnail-helper.sh batch-score ~/.cache/aidevops/thumbnails/[output_dir]/
thumbnail-helper.sh ab-test VIDEO_ID ~/.cache/aidevops/thumbnails/[output_dir]/
thumbnail-helper.sh analyze VIDEO_ID
```

### Test Execution

1. **Generate**: 10+ variants via `content/production-*.md` agents
2. **Deploy after owner approval**: platform-native A/B, separate social variants,
   a controlled site experiment, or a consent-compliant email split
3. **Collect**: 250+ samples per variant (CTR, retention, completion, time on page)
4. **Analyze**: Use the preregistered final look; check assignment integrity,
   sample/runtime/conversions, practical effect, confidence interval, and guardrails
5. **Prepare winner handoff**: Extract the supported pattern and request owner
   review; do not publish or mutate a provider from the analysis result
6. **Batch cycle**: Week 1 produce → Week 2 collect → Week 3 analyze and review →
   Week 4 produce the owner-approved next variants

## Evidence-Gated Optimization Handoff

Use `.agents/scripts/marketing-optimization-helper.py` for deterministic
attribution, experiment analysis, aggregate report drafts, and recommendations.
The normalized `_performance/marketing/` history remains the measurement source;
Content interprets the resulting aggregate evidence and prepares creative work.

Before a test starts, register an immutable experiment definition containing the
hypothesis, control and treatment asset snapshots, allocation, assignment unit,
primary and guardrail metrics, sample/runtime plan, stopping policy, privacy
threshold, campaign scope, and owner. Causal wording is allowed only when a
separate verified randomized and sticky assignment snapshot passes balance,
contamination, freshness, coverage, sample, runtime, conversion, practical-effect,
and guardrail checks. Missing or weak evidence produces no winner.

Direct and last-touch attribution are observational. Treat a leading allocation
as a hypothesis for a controlled test, not proof that the channel or creative
caused growth. Novelty, seasonality, contradictory metrics, stale sources, missing
touchpoints, refunds, and sparse cohorts remain caveats until the next
preregistered test resolves them.

Recommendation handoffs are bounded by action type:

- `content_iteration` → Content prepares a reviewable variant from an eligible
  causal experiment; the owner decides whether to publish it.
- `run_experiment` → Marketing/CRO preregisters and owns a controlled test for an
  observational attribution signal.
- `instrument` → Performance/Data improves coverage or freshness before another
  growth recommendation is attempted.

Every handoff must retain its report/evidence references, confidence, target
metric, expected-impact status or range, owner, required approval, rollback,
falsifier, and retest date. It grants no authority to publish, message, spend,
retarget, change an offer, mutate an account, or export an audience.

## Variant Generation

**Hook variants**: 10 per topic, all 7 types, 6-12 words each. Prompt: `Generate 10 hook variants for topic: [topic]. Use all 7 hook types, 6-12 words each. Output as table: Type | Hook | Word Count`

**Seed bracketing** (see `content/production-video.md`): Ranges — People 1000-1999, Action 2000-2999, Landscape 3000-3999, Product 4000-4999. Test 10 outputs; score: Composition 30%, Quality 30%, Style 20%, Accuracy 20%. Threshold: 4.0+ winner, 3.0-3.9 maybe, <3.0 reject. Cuts AI video costs ~60% (15% → 70%+ success).

**Scene-level testing**: Publish with approval → analyze retention curve → identify
>10% drops in <5s → generate 3-5 scene variants (B-roll, pacing, music, angle) →
run the approved comparison → prepare the supported variant for review.

**Thumbnail scoring**: CTR 50%, Text readability 20%, Face prominence 15%, Contrast 10%, Emotion 5%. Style template (Nanobanana Pro JSON): define palette/font/composition/lighting, swap subject, keep style constant. Test 10 thumbnails across 10 videos at 1000+ impressions.

## Analytics — Platform Metrics & Thresholds

| Platform | Metric | Bad | Good | Great | Action |
|----------|--------|-----|------|-------|--------|
| YouTube | CTR | <2% | 2-5% | >5% | Test thumbnails/titles → validate → review |
| YouTube | Retention | <30% | 30-50% | >50% | Test hooks → optimize pacing → replicate format |
| TikTok/Reels/Shorts | Completion | <50% | 50-70% | >70% | Fix hook → optimize → replicate |
| TikTok/Reels/Shorts | Shares | — | — | >3% | Strong signal — validate before scaling |
| TikTok/Reels/Shorts | Saves | — | — | >5% | High-value signal — test the pattern |
| Blog/SEO | Time on page | <1min | 1-3min | >3min | Content thin → decent → resonates |
| Blog/SEO | Scroll depth | <50% | — | >50% | Hook failed or too long |
| Blog/SEO | Bounce rate | >70% | — | <70% | Wrong audience or poor hook |
| Email | Open rate | <15% | 15-25% | >25% | Test subject lines → good → replicate |
| Email | Click rate | <2% | 2-5% | >5% | CTA failed → decent → offer works |

**Retention analysis**: YouTube Studio → Analytics → Retention → Export CSV. Identify >10% drops in <5s. Categorize: Hook failure (0:00-0:10), Pacing issue (gradual), Scene failure (sharp), Natural exit (gradual at end). Hypothesize → test fixes → compare.

**Content calendar**:

```bash
content-calendar-helper.sh cadence --weeks 1    # last week performance
content-calendar-helper.sh gaps --days 7        # missing next week
content-calendar-helper.sh due --days 7         # upcoming
content-calendar-helper.sh stats                # overall health
```

**Cadence**: YouTube 2-3/week | Shorts/TikTok/Reels daily | Blog 1-2/week | Email 1/week | Social daily

**Seasonality**: use dated, market-specific evidence rather than universal
quarter assumptions. Preserve locale, comparison windows, trend state, and
confidence from `seo/conversational-search-intent.md`; schedule with the
evidence-led rules in `content/content-calendar.md`.

**Feedback loop**: Publish after owner approval → collect normalized outcomes →
build an aggregate report → analyze preregistered evidence → review the
recommendation → feed validated learning into research → repeat. Do not recycle a
recommendation as independent evidence for itself.

## Proven structure, genuine twist

1. Find proven content: top YouTube videos, viral TikToks, high-traffic posts (Ahrefs/SEMrush)
2. Replicate structure (same hook type, different topic) — copy format, not content
3. Add a genuine product-specific twist: an evidenced angle, personality, visual style, example, or contrarian take
4. Test 10 variants, validate the supported pattern, and prepare it for owner
   review. Example: "We tested [verified sample] across [category]" →
   twist: "the free options that won documented comparisons" / "the trade-off that changed our recommendation"

## Tools & Integration

**Analytics**: YouTube Studio, TikTok Analytics, Google Analytics, Google Search Console (`seo/google-search-console.md`), DataForSEO (`seo/dataforseo.md`)

**A/B testing**: YouTube Studio (thumbnails), a controlled first-party site
experiment, VWO, Optimizely

**Scripts**: `marketing-optimization-helper.py` (aggregate attribution,
experiments, reports, recommendations) | `content-calendar-helper.sh`
(calendar/cadence/gaps, t208) | `analytics-helper.sh` (cross-platform reports) |
`variant-generator-helper.sh` (10 variants) | `seed-bracket-helper.sh` (AI video
seed testing) | `thumbnail-factory-helper.sh` (thumbnail variants, t207)

**Feeds into**: `content/research.md` (next research), `content/production-*.md` (next batch). **Uses from**: `content/distribution-*.md` (analytics), `content/production-*.md` (variants). **Related**: `reference/memory.md`.

**After optimization**: Store only owner-reviewed, evidence-qualified patterns,
update the calendar within approved authority, feed validated topics into the
research cycle, and preregister the next comparison rather than treating one
result as permanently proven.
