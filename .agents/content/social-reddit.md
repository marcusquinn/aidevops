# Reddit CLI/API Integration

## Delegated publishing exception

Reddit collection remains read-only. Publishing defaults to exact owner approval.
An owner may opt into the bounded policy lane documented in
`reference/public-engagement-policy.md`; it supports only disclosed text
posts/replies through `knowledge_social_operations.py` and the existing private
outbox. Never write through direct PRAW/SDK calls, collectors, MCP tools, or read
tokens.

- **Install**: `pip install praw`
- **Repo**: https://github.com/praw-dev/praw (4k+ stars, Python, BSD-2)
- **Docs**: https://praw.readthedocs.io/
- **Rate limits**: Unauthenticated JSON: 96 req/10min per IP. Authenticated OAuth: 996 req/10min per account. PRAW handles rate limiting automatically; add `time.sleep(1)` for raw JSON endpoints.

## No-Auth (append `.json` to any Reddit URL)

```bash
# Subreddit posts
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/hot.json?limit=10" | jq '.data.children[].data | {title, score, url}'

# Post comments
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/POST_ID.json" | jq '.[1].data.children[].data | {author, body, score}'

# User profile
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/user/USERNAME/about.json" | jq '.data | {name, link_karma, comment_karma}'

# Search
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=aidevops&sort=relevance" | jq '.data.children[].data | {title, subreddit, score}'
```

## PRAW (Authenticated)

OAuth app: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps → create "script" type. Store a
named profile with `aidevops secret set REDDIT_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID` and matching
`CLIENT_SECRET`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `USER_AGENT` entries; never put the
values in a command or repository file.

```python
import os

import praw

reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id=os.environ["REDDIT_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["REDDIT_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    user_agent=os.environ["REDDIT_DEFAULT_USER_AGENT"],
    username=os.environ["REDDIT_DEFAULT_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["REDDIT_DEFAULT_PASSWORD"],
)

# Read subreddit
for post in reddit.subreddit("devops").hot(limit=10):
    print(f"{post.score}: {post.title}")

# Read one comment
comment = reddit.comment("COMMENT_ID")
print(comment.body)
```

Use direct PRAW calls for reads only. Every automated post, reply, upvote, or
save must use the owner-only queue through `operation-create`; never call PRAW
write methods directly from automation.

## Read-only account knowledge synchronization

Use `sync-reddit` for authenticated corpus collection. The optional dependency
must be PRAW major version 8 and must be installed outside the agent session.
Store one secret set for each lowercase profile slug:

- `REDDIT_<PROFILE>_CLIENT_ID`
- `REDDIT_<PROFILE>_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `REDDIT_<PROFILE>_USERNAME`
- `REDDIT_<PROFILE>_PASSWORD`
- `REDDIT_<PROFILE>_USER_AGENT`

The selected profile is local execution state. It is never stored in evidence,
receipts, cursors, or command output. Run one explicitly selected stream:

```bash
aidevops secret REDDIT_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID REDDIT_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET \
  REDDIT_DEFAULT_USERNAME REDDIT_DEFAULT_PASSWORD REDDIT_DEFAULT_USER_AGENT -- \
  knowledge-social-helper.sh sync-reddit --alias personal:default \
  --connection-id REDDIT_CONNECTION_ID \
  --account-id STABLE_REDDIT_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --stream saved --profile default --budget 10 --page-size 100
```

The read adapter verifies `reddit.user.me().id` before collecting and exposes
these independently checkpointed streams:

- authored submissions and comments;
- mentions, comment replies, submission replies, inbox messages, and sent
  messages;
- saved, upvoted, downvoted, and hidden submissions/comments;
- subscribed, moderated, and contributor subreddits;
- multireddits/custom feeds and their subreddit membership;
- friends, blocked accounts, and trusted accounts.

Listing streams fetch one bounded page per request unit. Initial history resumes
from PRAW's stable fullname checkpoint. Newest-first streams retain their first
item as a watermark and stop a later incremental scan when that item is reached.
Reddit listing retention is provider-limited, so an exhausted listing proves only
the available provider window. Relationship and custom-feed snapshots restart
from the beginning after a complete run and never infer deletion from a partial
or failed snapshot.

The child process receives only the selected profile's environment variables,
has a hard timeout, serializes an explicit field allowlist without lazy model
fetches, and returns sanitized failure classes. The collector cannot import or
invoke posting, reply, voting, saving, messaging, moderation, or subscription
mutation methods. Provider writes remain in the separate approval queue below.

## Approval-bound outbound operations

Automated writes use the owner-only social operation queue rather than direct
PRAW snippets. The connection fixes provider `reddit` and its stable account ID;
`--profile default` selects only `REDDIT_DEFAULT_*` environment variables. Every
immutable draft requires a separate owner approval before execution.

```bash
# Self-post: subject and body remain in separate mode-0600 files until execution.
knowledge-social-helper.sh operation-create --alias workspace:example \
  --connection-id REDDIT_CONNECTION_ID --account-id STABLE_REDDIT_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --action post --destination-id SUBREDDIT_NAME --subject-file subject.txt \
  --body-file post.txt --profile default

# Reply targets t1_ comments or t3_ submissions. Like maps to upvote; bookmark to save.
knowledge-social-helper.sh operation-create --alias workspace:example \
  --connection-id REDDIT_CONNECTION_ID --account-id STABLE_REDDIT_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --action reply --target-id t1_COMMENT_ID --body-file reply.txt \
  --profile default
```

Execution verifies `reddit.user.me().id` against the approved stable account
before recording the provider boundary. A timeout or provider failure after that
boundary becomes `unknown` and requires external reconciliation; it is never
blindly retried. Multiple accounts use separate profile slugs and separate
`REDDIT_<PROFILE>_*` secret sets.
