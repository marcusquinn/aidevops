# Content Story Design

Narrative frameworks, hook formulas, and angle selection for creating compelling content that captures attention and drives engagement.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Story structure, hooks, angles, and narrative frameworks for content
- **Input**: Topic, audience profile (from `content/research.md`), content type
- **Output**: Story brief with hook variants, narrative arc, angle selection
- **Related**: `content/research.md` (audience insights), `content/production/writing.md` (script execution), `youtube/script-writer.md` (video-specific)

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Hook Formulas

The first 3-7 seconds determine whether your content gets consumed or skipped. Use these proven hook types with a 6-12 word constraint for maximum impact.

### 7 Hook Types

#### 1. Bold Claim Hook

Make a provocative statement that challenges conventional wisdom.

**Formula**: "[Surprising statistic/claim] that [contradicts common belief]"

**Examples**:
- "95% of AI influencers fail within 6 months"
- "This $5 tool outperforms $500 software"
- "I made $10K with zero followers"

**When to use**: You have data or proof to back the claim, audience is skeptical of mainstream advice.

#### 2. Question Hook

Pose a question the audience is already asking themselves.

**Formula**: "[Pain point question] + [hint at solution]"

**Examples**:
- "Why do your videos get views but no sales?"
- "What if you could automate content in 10 minutes?"
- "Are you making this fatal SEO mistake?"

**When to use**: Audience is actively searching for solutions, you're addressing a known pain point.

#### 3. Story Hook

Start with a relatable narrative moment.

**Formula**: "[Time/place] + [relatable situation] + [turning point]"

**Examples**:
- "Three months ago I was broke. Today I run a 7-figure agency."
- "I spent $50K on ads before learning this one trick"
- "My first video got 12 views. My tenth got 2 million."

**When to use**: You have a compelling transformation story, audience responds to personal narratives.

#### 4. Contrarian Hook

Challenge popular advice or trends.

**Formula**: "Everyone says [common advice]. Here's why they're wrong."

**Examples**:
- "Stop posting daily. Here's what actually works."
- "Forget SEO. Do this instead."
- "AI won't replace you. But this will."

**When to use**: Audience is tired of generic advice, you have a differentiated approach.

#### 5. Result Hook

Lead with the outcome, create curiosity about the method.

**Formula**: "[Impressive result] in [timeframe] using [unexpected method]"

**Examples**:
- "10K subscribers in 30 days with zero budget"
- "I 10x'd my traffic by deleting 80% of my content"
- "This 5-minute daily habit doubled my income"

**When to use**: You have verifiable results, the method is non-obvious.

#### 6. Problem-Agitate Hook

Identify a pain point and amplify the frustration.

**Formula**: "[Pain point] + [why it's worse than they think] + [hint at solution]"

**Examples**:
- "Your content isn't bad. Your distribution is killing you."
- "You're not lazy. Your system is broken."
- "Low engagement? It's not the algorithm. It's this."

**When to use**: Audience is experiencing the pain but misdiagnosing the cause.

#### 7. Curiosity Gap Hook

Create information asymmetry that demands resolution.

**Formula**: "[Intriguing partial reveal] + [withhold the key detail]"

**Examples**:
- "I changed one word in my headline. CTR jumped 340%."
- "This free tool does what $10K agencies charge for"
- "The secret isn't more content. It's this."

**When to use**: You have a non-obvious insight, audience is sophisticated enough to appreciate nuance.

### Hook Testing Discipline

**Never commit to a single hook.** Generate 5-10 variants per piece of content before choosing.

**A/B testing rules**:
- Minimum 10 variants per topic
- 250-sample rule before judging performance
- Below 2% CTR = kill
- Above 2% CTR = scale
- Above 3% CTR = go aggressive

**Hook variant generation process**:
1. Write 10 hooks using different types (2x Bold Claim, 2x Question, 2x Story, etc.)
2. Score each on: clarity (1-5), curiosity (1-5), specificity (1-5)
3. Test top 3 in real distribution
4. Double down on winner

## 4-Part Script Framework

Every piece of content should follow this structure, regardless of format (video, blog, social post).

### Part 1: Hook (First 3-7 seconds)

**Purpose**: Stop the scroll, earn the next 10 seconds.

**Elements**:
- Use one of the 7 hook types above
- Visual + verbal alignment (what they see matches what they hear)
- Pattern interrupt (contrast, extremes, unexpected combinations)

**Length**: 6-12 words for short-form, 1-2 sentences for long-form.

### Part 2: Storytelling (Middle 60-80%)

**Purpose**: Build credibility, create emotional connection, deliver value.

**Structure options** (choose based on content type):

#### Before/During/After Arc

Best for: Transformation stories, case studies, tutorials.

- **Before**: Paint the pain state (relatable struggle)
- **During**: Show the journey (obstacles, discoveries, turning points)
- **After**: Reveal the outcome (specific results, new reality)

#### Problem-Solution-Result

Best for: How-to content, product demos, explainers.

- **Problem**: Define the pain point with specificity
- **Solution**: Introduce your method/tool/framework
- **Result**: Show proof it works (data, testimonials, examples)

#### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

Best for: Sales content, landing pages, ads.

- **Attention**: Hook (covered above)
- **Interest**: Why this matters to them specifically
- **Desire**: Paint the future state, amplify the gap
- **Action**: Clear next step

#### Three-Act Structure

Best for: Long-form narratives, video essays, documentaries.

- **Act 1 (Setup)**: Introduce the world, characters, stakes
- **Act 2 (Confrontation)**: Obstacles, rising tension, complications
- **Act 3 (Resolution)**: Climax, resolution, takeaway

#### Hero's Journey (Simplified)

Best for: Brand stories, founder narratives, mission-driven content.

- **Ordinary World**: Where you started (relatable)
- **Call to Adventure**: The problem that forced change
- **Trials**: Obstacles and failures along the way
- **Transformation**: What you learned, how you changed
- **Return with Gift**: What you now share with the audience

#### Listicle with Stakes

Best for: Tips, frameworks, lists (but make them compelling).

- **Setup**: Why this list matters (the cost of not knowing)
- **Items**: Each point has a mini-story or specific example
- **Payoff**: What changes when you apply all items

**Storytelling principles** (apply to any structure):

- **Specificity over vagueness**: "I spent $47,382 on Facebook ads" beats "I spent a lot on ads"
- **Show, don't tell**: "My hands shook as I hit publish" beats "I was nervous"
- **Dialogue and scenes**: Use direct quotes, recreate moments
- **Emotional cues**: Name the feeling ("I felt like a fraud", "I was terrified")
- **Pacing**: Vary sentence length, use pauses, build tension

### Part 3: Soft Sell (Last 10-20%)

**Purpose**: Transition from value to action without breaking trust.

**Soft sell patterns**:

- **Natural bridge**: "If you want to go deeper on this, I've created [resource]"
- **Next logical step**: "Now that you know X, the next question is Y. Here's how..."
- **Tool/resource mention**: "The tool I use for this is [link in description]"
- **Community invitation**: "Join 10K others learning this in [community]"

**Hard sell patterns** (use sparingly, only when trust is established):

- **Limited offer**: "This closes Friday. Link below."
- **Scarcity**: "Only 10 spots left for [program]"
- **Urgency**: "Price goes up Monday. Lock in now."

**Sell/value ratio by content type**:
- Educational content: 90% value, 10% sell
- Product reviews: 70% value, 30% sell
- Sales pages: 50% value, 50% sell
- Ads: 30% value, 70% sell

### Part 4: Visual Cues (Throughout)

**Purpose**: Reinforce the narrative with visual storytelling.

**Visual elements**:
- **B-roll**: Illustrate key points (show the tool, the result, the process)
- **Text overlays**: Emphasize key phrases, stats, quotes
- **Scene changes**: Match pacing (fast cuts for energy, slow for reflection)
- **Visual metaphors**: Abstract concepts made concrete (growth = plant growing, complexity = tangled wires)

**Visual pacing rules**:
- **UGC/short-form**: 1-3 second cuts (high energy, constant stimulation)
- **Commercial**: 2-5 second cuts (polished, professional)
- **Cinematic**: 4-10 second cuts (immersive, emotional)
- **Documentary**: 5-15 second cuts (thoughtful, informative)

**Visual-verbal alignment**:
- What they see should match what they hear within 0.5 seconds
- If you say "this tool", show the tool
- If you say "before and after", show the comparison

## Campaign Audit Process

Before launching content at scale, audit your campaign using this 7-step framework.

### 1. Analyze Offer: Homework vs Value

**Question**: Does your offer require work from the audience, or does it deliver immediate value?

**Homework offers** (require effort):
- Courses, tutorials, guides
- Tools that need setup
- Frameworks that need implementation

**Value offers** (immediate gratification):
- Done-for-you services
- Templates, swipe files
- Entertainment, inspiration

**Audit**:
- If homework: Is the payoff 10x the effort? Do you show proof it works?
- If value: Is it immediately usable? Does it deliver on the promise in <5 minutes?

### 2. Check Urgency

**Question**: Why should they act now instead of later?

**Urgency types**:
- **Time-based**: Deadline, limited window
- **Scarcity**: Limited quantity, exclusive access
- **Consequence**: Cost of delay (problem gets worse, opportunity closes)
- **Momentum**: Social proof (others are acting now)

**Audit**:
- Is urgency real or manufactured? (Real urgency converts better)
- Is the deadline clear and visible?
- What happens if they wait? (Make the cost explicit)

### 3. Analyze Pain Angle

**Question**: Are you addressing a pain point or an aspiration?

**Pain-driven content**:
- Problem-focused ("Stop losing money on ads")
- Fear-based ("Your competitors are doing this")
- Frustration-based ("Tired of low engagement?")

**Aspiration-driven content**:
- Goal-focused ("Build a 6-figure agency")
- Identity-based ("Become a top 1% creator")
- Vision-based ("Imagine waking up to passive income")

**Audit**:
- Which is stronger for your audience? (Test both)
- Pain works for immediate problems, aspiration for long-term goals
- Can you combine both? ("Stop struggling with X, start achieving Y")

### 4. Cosmetic vs Life-Changing

**Question**: Is your offer a nice-to-have or a must-have?

**Cosmetic** (nice-to-have):
- Incremental improvements
- Optimization, efficiency gains
- Aesthetic upgrades

**Life-changing** (must-have):
- Solves a critical problem
- Unlocks a new capability
- Transforms identity or status

**Audit**:
- If cosmetic: Can you reframe it as life-changing? (Show the compounding effect)
- If life-changing: Are you communicating the magnitude? (Use before/after, testimonials)

### 5. Audit Hook + Visual First 3 Seconds

**Question**: Do the first 3 seconds stop the scroll?

**Hook audit checklist**:
- [ ] Is it 6-12 words? (Longer = lower retention)
- [ ] Does it create curiosity or promise value?
- [ ] Is it specific? (Vague hooks get skipped)
- [ ] Does it match audience language? (Use their words, not yours)

**Visual audit checklist**:
- [ ] Is there a pattern interrupt? (Contrast, movement, unexpected element)
- [ ] Does the visual match the verbal? (Alignment within 0.5 seconds)
- [ ] Is the subject clear? (No visual clutter in first frame)
- [ ] Is there a human face? (Faces increase retention by 20-30%)

### 6. Implement All 4 Elements

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Hook: Stops the scroll (Part 1)
- [ ] Storytelling: Builds credibility and connection (Part 2)
- [ ] Soft Sell: Natural transition to action (Part 3)
- [ ] Visual Cues: Reinforce narrative throughout (Part 4)

**Common mistakes**:
- Hook without story (no depth, no trust)
- Story without sell (value but no conversion)
- Sell without story (pushy, low trust)
- Verbal without visual (missed opportunity for reinforcement)

### 7. Test and Measure

**Metrics by content type**:

| Content Type | Primary Metric | Secondary Metrics |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| YouTube | CTR, Avg View Duration | Likes, Comments, Shares |
| TikTok/Reels | Completion Rate | Shares, Saves, Profile Visits |
| Blog | Time on Page | Scroll Depth, Bounce Rate, Conversions |
| Email | Open Rate | Click Rate, Reply Rate |
| Ad | CTR | CPC, Conversion Rate, ROAS |

**Testing framework**:
1. Launch with 10 variants (different hooks, same core content)
2. Collect 250 samples per variant minimum
3. Kill bottom 50% (below 2% CTR or median performance)
4. Double down on top 2-3 performers
5. Iterate: Create 5 new variants based on winners

## Pain vs Aspiration Angle Selection

Choose your content angle based on audience awareness and emotional state.

### Pain Angle (Problem-Focused)

**When to use**:
- Audience is actively experiencing the problem
- Problem is urgent or getting worse
- Audience is searching for solutions (high intent)
- You're targeting bottom-of-funnel (ready to buy)

**Structure**:
1. **Identify pain**: Name the specific problem
2. **Agitate**: Show why it's worse than they think
3. **Amplify cost**: What they lose by not solving it
4. **Introduce solution**: Your method/product/framework
5. **Proof**: Show it works (case studies, data)

**Example**: "Your content isn't bad. Your distribution is killing you. Here's why 90% of creators waste hours on content that nobody sees — and the 3-step system that fixes it."

### Aspiration Angle (Goal-Focused)

**When to use**:
- Audience is dreaming about a future state
- Problem is chronic but not urgent
- Audience is browsing, not searching (low intent)
- You're targeting top-of-funnel (awareness stage)

**Structure**:
1. **Paint the vision**: Describe the desired future state
2. **Create gap**: Show the distance between now and then
3. **Show the path**: Your method bridges the gap
4. **Proof**: Others have achieved it (social proof)
5. **Invitation**: Join them

**Example**: "Imagine waking up to $10K in passive income. No boss, no commute, no limits. Here's the exact system 1,000+ people used to build location-independent businesses."

### Hybrid Angle (Pain + Aspiration)

**When to use**:
- Audience is aware of the problem but needs motivation
- You want to appeal to both emotional drivers
- Content is long-form (room for both)

**Structure**:
1. **Start with pain**: Hook with the problem
2. **Transition to aspiration**: "But what if..."
3. **Show the bridge**: Your solution connects both
4. **Proof**: Before/after transformation
5. **Call to action**: Move from pain to aspiration

**Example**: "Tired of trading time for money? (Pain) Imagine earning while you sleep. (Aspiration) Here's the 4-step system that took me from burnout to $50K/month passive income."

## Pattern Interrupt Principle

The brain filters out predictable patterns. Use contrast, extremes, and unexpected combinations to break through.

### Contrast

**Visual contrast**:
- Bright vs dark
- Fast vs slow motion
- Chaos vs calm
- Crowded vs empty

**Verbal contrast**:
- "Everyone says X. I say Y."
- "You think it's A. It's actually B."
- "Before: [bad]. After: [good]."

### Extremes

**Exaggerate for effect** (but stay truthful):
- "I spent $50K learning this. You'll learn it in 10 minutes."
- "This took me 5 years. I'll teach it in 5 steps."
- "Most people do 100 things. I do 3."

**Use extreme specificity**:
- Not "a lot of money" → "$47,382"
- Not "many people" → "1,847 students"
- Not "recently" → "Last Tuesday at 3:47pm"

### Unexpected Combinations

**Pair opposites**:
- "The lazy way to work harder"
- "Get rich by spending less"
- "Fail faster to succeed sooner"

**Violate expectations**:
- "I deleted 80% of my content. Traffic doubled."
- "I stopped posting daily. Engagement tripled."
- "I raised my prices. Sales increased."

## Storytelling Frameworks (Generalized)

These frameworks apply across all content types (video, blog, social, email, podcast).

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

Classic marketing framework, still effective.

**Attention**: Hook (see 7 hook types above)
**Interest**: Why this matters to them specifically
**Desire**: Paint the future state, amplify the gap
**Action**: Clear next step

**Best for**: Sales content, landing pages, ads.

### Three-Act Structure

Borrowed from screenwriting, works for any narrative.

**Act 1 (Setup)**: Introduce the world, characters, stakes (25%)
**Act 2 (Confrontation)**: Obstacles, rising tension, complications (50%)
**Act 3 (Resolution)**: Climax, resolution, takeaway (25%)

**Best for**: Long-form narratives, video essays, documentaries.

### Hero's Journey (Simplified)

Joseph Campbell's monomyth, adapted for content.

**Ordinary World**: Where you started (relatable)
**Call to Adventure**: The problem that forced change
**Trials**: Obstacles and failures along the way
**Transformation**: What you learned, how you changed
**Return with Gift**: What you now share with the audience

**Best for**: Brand stories, founder narratives, mission-driven content.

### Problem-Solution-Result

Straightforward, high-converting structure.

**Problem**: Define the pain point with specificity
**Solution**: Introduce your method/tool/framework
**Result**: Show proof it works (data, testimonials, examples)

**Best for**: How-to content, product demos, explainers.

### Listicle with Stakes

Make lists compelling by adding narrative tension.

**Setup**: Why this list matters (the cost of not knowing)
**Items**: Each point has a mini-story or specific example
**Payoff**: What changes when you apply all items

**Best for**: Tips, frameworks, lists.

### Before/During/After Transformation Arc

Show the journey from pain to solution to outcome.

**Before**: Paint the pain state (relatable struggle)
**During**: Show the journey (obstacles, discoveries, turning points)
**After**: Reveal the outcome (specific results, new reality)

**Best for**: Transformation stories, case studies, tutorials.

## "Proven First, Original Second" Strategy

Don't reinvent the wheel. Iterate on what already works.

### The 3% Twist Rule

**Process**:
1. Find content that's already performing well (high views, engagement, shares)
2. Analyze why it works (hook, angle, structure, proof)
3. Recreate 97% of the structure
4. Add 3% originality (your unique insight, example, or twist)

**Example**:
- **Proven**: "I made $10K in 30 days with [method]"
- **Your twist**: "I made $10K in 30 days with [method] — but here's what nobody tells you"

### Pattern Recognition

**Study top performers in your niche**:
- What hooks do they use repeatedly?
- What story structures appear most often?
- What angles get the most engagement?
- What formats dominate? (Talking head, B-roll, screen recording)

**Replicate the pattern, not the content**:
- Use the same hook type, different topic
- Use the same structure, different story
- Use the same angle, different proof

### Iteration Over Innovation

**Why this works**:
- Proven content has already passed the market test
- Audiences have pattern recognition (familiar = trustworthy)
- You reduce risk (higher probability of success)
- You save time (no need to test 100 angles)

**When to innovate**:
- You have a genuinely unique insight (rare)
- The market is saturated with the proven pattern (diminishing returns)
- You're building a differentiated brand (long-term play)

## Integration

- **Feeds into**: `content/production/writing.md` (script execution), `youtube/script-writer.md` (video scripts), `content/production/video.md` (visual storytelling)
- **Uses data from**: `content/research.md` (audience insights, pain points, competitor gaps)
- **Related**: `content/optimization.md` (A/B testing hooks and angles), `content/distribution/short-form.md` (platform-specific hook adaptation)
