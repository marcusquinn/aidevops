# Content Story

Narrative design frameworks for crafting compelling hooks, angles, and story structures that capture attention and drive engagement.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Narrative design, hooks, angles, storytelling frameworks
- **Input**: Research brief, topic, target audience
- **Output**: Story angle, hook variants, narrative structure
- **Related**: `content/research.md` (audience insights), `content/production/writing.md` (script execution), `youtube/script-writer.md` (video-specific patterns)

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Workflow

### 1. Hook Formulas

The first 3-6 seconds determine if your content gets consumed or skipped. Hooks must be **6-12 words maximum** and follow proven patterns.

**7 Hook Types**:

1. **Bold Claim**
   - Pattern: "[Extreme statement] and here's proof"
   - Example: "I made $50K in 30 days with AI"
   - Use when: You have verifiable results to back it up

2. **Question Hook**
   - Pattern: "[Provocative question that creates curiosity gap]"
   - Example: "What if everything you know about SEO is wrong?"
   - Use when: Challenging conventional wisdom or revealing secrets

3. **Story Hook**
   - Pattern: "[Relatable moment] changed everything for me"
   - Example: "I was broke, desperate, then I discovered this"
   - Use when: Building emotional connection through transformation

4. **Contrarian Hook**
   - Pattern: "Stop [common advice]. Do this instead."
   - Example: "Stop posting daily. Post smart instead."
   - Use when: Positioning against mainstream advice

5. **Result Hook**
   - Pattern: "[Specific outcome] in [timeframe] using [method]"
   - Example: "10K followers in 90 days without paid ads"
   - Use when: You have measurable, time-bound results

6. **Problem-Agitate Hook**
   - Pattern: "[Pain point]? Here's why it's worse than you think"
   - Example: "Your content isn't failing. Your hook is killing it."
   - Use when: Amplifying awareness of a problem before solving it

7. **Curiosity Gap Hook**
   - Pattern: "[Intriguing incomplete statement]"
   - Example: "The one thing every viral video has in common"
   - Use when: Withholding key information to create tension

**Hook Constraints**:

- **6-12 words maximum** -- longer hooks lose attention
- **First 3 seconds** -- visual + audio must align with hook
- **Pattern interrupt** -- contrast, extremes, unexpected combinations
- **Specificity** -- "I made $50K" beats "I made money"

**Hook Testing**:

Generate **5-10 hook variants** per topic before committing. Test criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Clarity (instantly understandable) | 30% | |
| Curiosity (creates information gap) | 25% | |
| Relevance (matches audience pain/aspiration) | 25% | |
| Specificity (concrete vs vague) | 10% | |
| Brevity (6-12 words) | 10% | |

**Weighted score 4.0+** = strong hook, proceed to production.

### 2. Four-Part Script Framework

Every piece of content follows this structure, regardless of format (video, blog, social post).

**Part 1: Hook (First 3-6 seconds)**

- Deliver the hook (see formulas above)
- Visual must match audio (show the result, the problem, the transformation)
- No intro, no "hey guys", no preamble -- straight to value

**Part 2: Storytelling (Middle 60-80%)**

- **Before/During/After transformation arc**:
  - **Before**: Where you/they were (relatable struggle)
  - **During**: The turning point (discovery, method, insight)
  - **After**: Where you/they are now (tangible result)

- **Pacing rules**:
  - Short-form: 1-3 second cuts, fast pacing
  - Long-form: 4-10 second scenes, breathing room
  - Documentary: 5-15 second scenes, contemplative

- **Engagement loops** (every 15-30 seconds):
  - Tease next point: "But here's where it gets interesting..."
  - Ask rhetorical question: "So what does this mean for you?"
  - Show visual proof: B-roll, screenshot, result

**Part 3: Soft Sell (Last 10-20%)**

- **Not a hard pitch** -- offer next step as natural continuation
- Patterns:
  - "If you want to go deeper, link in bio"
  - "I made a full guide on this, check description"
  - "Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send you the template"

- **Monetization routing** (in priority order):
  1. **Affiliates first** -- lowest friction, market research signal
  2. **Info products** -- $5-27 cold traffic offers (guides, templates, mini-courses)
  3. **Upsell** -- higher-ticket offers for engaged audience

- **Q4 seasonality** -- buying intent peaks Oct-Dec, plan monetization content accordingly

**Part 4: Visual Cues (Throughout)**

- **Text overlays**: Emphasise key points (3-5 words max per overlay)
- **B-roll**: Show don't tell (results, process, proof)
- **Transitions**: Match pacing (fast cuts for energy, slow fades for contemplation)
- **Captions**: Always on (80% watch without sound)

### 3. Angle Selection Framework

The **angle** is the unique perspective or approach that differentiates your content from competitors covering the same topic.

**Pain vs Aspiration**:

| Angle Type | When to Use | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Pain-focused** | Audience is problem-aware, seeking solutions | "Why your content isn't getting views (and how to fix it)" |
| **Aspiration-focused** | Audience is goal-oriented, seeking growth | "How to build a 100K subscriber channel in 12 months" |
| **Hybrid** | Balanced approach for broad appeal | "From 0 views to 1M: What I wish I knew starting out" |

**Angle Audit Process** (7 steps):

1. **Analyse offer homework-vs-value ratio**
   - Homework: What the audience must do
   - Value: What they get in return
   - Ratio: High value, low homework = strong angle

2. **Check urgency**
   - Does the angle create time pressure? ("Before it's too late", "While this still works")
   - Urgency without manipulation (real deadlines, seasonal relevance, market shifts)

3. **Analyse pain angle depth**
   - Surface pain: "I want more views"
   - Deep pain: "I'm creating content nobody sees and I feel invisible"
   - **Use exact audience language** from Reddit, forums, comments

4. **Cosmetic vs life-changing**
   - Cosmetic: "Get 10% more engagement"
   - Life-changing: "Quit your job with content income"
   - Higher stakes = higher engagement (but must be credible)

5. **Audit hook + visual first 3 seconds**
   - Do they align? (Audio says "I made $50K", visual shows bank statement)
   - Pattern interrupt? (Unexpected visual, contrarian statement)

6. **Implement all 4 framework elements**
   - Hook, Storytelling, Soft Sell, Visual Cues (see Part 2)

7. **Test and measure**
   - CTR (thumbnail + title for YouTube)
   - Retention (first 30 seconds, overall)
   - Engagement (comments, shares, saves)

### 4. Storytelling Frameworks

Proven narrative structures for different content types.

**AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)**

- **Attention**: Hook (see formulas)
- **Interest**: Why this matters to them (pain or aspiration)
- **Desire**: Show the transformation (before/after)
- **Action**: Clear next step (soft sell)

Best for: Sales-oriented content, landing pages, ads

**Three-Act Structure**

- **Act 1 (Setup)**: Introduce the problem or goal
- **Act 2 (Confrontation)**: The struggle, the journey, the obstacles
- **Act 3 (Resolution)**: The solution, the result, the lesson

Best for: Long-form video, case studies, documentary-style content

**Hero's Journey (Simplified)**

- **Ordinary World**: Where the hero (you/them) starts
- **Call to Adventure**: The problem or opportunity
- **Trials**: The challenges faced
- **Transformation**: The change that occurs
- **Return**: Sharing the wisdom/result

Best for: Personal brand content, transformation stories, testimonials

**Problem-Solution-Result**

- **Problem**: State the pain point (specific, relatable)
- **Solution**: Introduce the method/tool/insight
- **Result**: Show the outcome (quantified if possible)

Best for: Tutorial content, product reviews, how-to guides

**Listicle with Stakes**

- **Hook**: "X things that [outcome]"
- **Stakes**: Why this matters (what happens if they ignore it)
- **List items**: Each with mini-story or example
- **Callback**: Tie back to stakes in conclusion

Best for: Educational content, tips/tricks, resource roundups

**Note**: YouTube-specific script patterns (scene-by-scene structure, B-roll directions, retention hooks) are in `youtube/script-writer.md`. The frameworks above are **format-agnostic** and apply to blog posts, social content, video, podcasts, etc.

### 5. Campaign Audit Process

Before launching a content campaign (series of related pieces), audit the strategy using this 7-step process.

**Step 1: Analyse Offer Homework-vs-Value**

- What are you asking the audience to do? (watch 10 min video, read 2000 words, buy $27 product)
- What do they get in return? (specific outcome, transformation, tool)
- Is the value 10x the homework? If not, increase value or reduce friction.

**Step 2: Check Urgency**

- Is there a reason to act now vs later?
- Real urgency: seasonal relevance (Q4 buying), market shifts (new platform feature), limited availability
- Avoid fake urgency: "Only 3 spots left!" when it's evergreen

**Step 3: Analyse Pain Angle**

- Are you addressing surface pain or deep pain?
- Surface: "I want more followers"
- Deep: "I feel like I'm shouting into the void and nobody cares"
- **Extract exact language from Reddit, forums, YouTube comments** -- use their words, not yours

**Step 4: Cosmetic vs Life-Changing**

- Cosmetic: Small improvement, nice-to-have
- Life-changing: Significant transformation, must-have
- Higher stakes = higher engagement, but must be **credible and achievable**

**Step 5: Audit Hook + Visual First 3 Seconds**

- Does the visual match the audio hook?
- Is there a pattern interrupt? (unexpected visual, contrarian statement, extreme result)
- Would you stop scrolling if you saw this?

**Step 6: Implement All 4 Elements**

- Hook (6-12 words, proven formula)
- Storytelling (before/during/after arc)
- Soft Sell (natural next step, not hard pitch)
- Visual Cues (text overlays, B-roll, captions)

**Step 7: Test and Measure**

- **Minimum 10 variants** before judging an angle
- **250-sample rule** before declaring success/failure
- **Performance thresholds**:
  - Below 2% CTR/engagement = kill
  - Above 2% = scale
  - Above 3% = go aggressive (daily posting, paid promotion)

### 6. Proven First, Original Second

**Strategy**: Start with proven formats, add 3% twist for differentiation.

**Why this works**:

- Proven formats have known success patterns (audience already trained to engage)
- 100% original = high risk (no validation, audience may not understand)
- 100% copy = no differentiation (algorithm penalises, audience ignores)
- **3% twist** = familiar enough to work, unique enough to stand out

**How to apply**:

1. **Find proven content** in your niche (viral videos, top blog posts, high-engagement social posts)
2. **Reverse-engineer the structure** (hook type, story arc, pacing, visual style)
3. **Identify the core pattern** (what makes it work -- curiosity gap, transformation arc, contrarian angle)
4. **Add your 3% twist**:
   - Different niche/audience (same format, new market)
   - Updated context (same story, current events)
   - Your unique proof (same claim, your results)
   - Format migration (TikTok video → blog post → Twitter thread)

**Example**:

- **Proven**: "I tried [thing] for 30 days, here's what happened"
- **Your 3% twist**: "I tried [your thing] for 30 days as a [your unique context], here's what nobody tells you"

### 7. Pattern Interrupt Principle

**Definition**: Breaking expected patterns to capture attention.

**Techniques**:

1. **Contrast**
   - Visual: Bright color in muted scene, fast cut after slow scene
   - Audio: Silence after loud music, whisper after shouting
   - Content: Contrarian take after conventional wisdom

2. **Extremes**
   - Numbers: "$0 to $100K", "1 follower to 1M"
   - Time: "In 24 hours", "After 10 years"
   - Emotion: Desperation to triumph, confusion to clarity

3. **Unexpected Combinations**
   - "[Unlikely thing] taught me [unrelated lesson]"
   - Example: "My failed startup taught me how to go viral on TikTok"

4. **Format Breaks**
   - Start with the end (show result first, then rewind)
   - Break the fourth wall (acknowledge you're making content)
   - Genre mash-up (documentary style for product review)

**When to use**: First 3 seconds (hook), mid-content (retention loop), transitions between sections.
