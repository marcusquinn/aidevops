# Content Story - Narrative Design

Strategic narrative design for multi-channel content creation. Covers hook formulas, storytelling frameworks, angle selection, campaign audit methodology, and transformation arcs.

## When to Use

Read this subagent when you need to:

- Design compelling hooks for any content format
- Choose the right storytelling framework for your content type
- Select pain vs aspiration angles for campaigns
- Audit existing content for narrative effectiveness
- Apply transformation arcs (Before/During/After)
- Create pattern interrupts that maintain attention
- Develop unique angles using the "proven first, original second" strategy

## Hook Formulas

The hook is the most critical element across all content formats. Constraint: **6-12 words maximum** for maximum impact.

### 1. Bold Claim Hook

**Pattern**: [Surprising statement that challenges assumptions]

**Examples**:
- "This $5 tool outperforms every $500 alternative."
- "I doubled my revenue by doing less work."
- "The best marketing strategy costs nothing."

**Best for**: Product reviews, contrarian takes, case studies

### 2. Question Hook

**Pattern**: [Question that the audience desperately wants answered]

**Examples**:
- "Why do 90% of startups fail in year one?"
- "What if everything you know about SEO is wrong?"
- "Can AI really replace your entire marketing team?"

**Best for**: Educational content, problem-solving, curiosity-driven topics

### 3. Story Hook

**Pattern**: [Drop into the middle of a compelling story]

**Examples**:
- "Three months ago, I was broke. Today, I'm not."
- "The email that changed my entire business arrived at 2am."
- "I lost $50K before I learned this one thing."

**Best for**: Personal narratives, transformation stories, case studies

### 4. Contrarian Hook

**Pattern**: [Statement that goes against popular belief]

**Examples**:
- "Everything you've been told about productivity is backwards."
- "The best content strategy is to post less, not more."
- "Your competitors are wrong about this one thing."

**Best for**: Thought leadership, disrupting conventional wisdom, positioning

### 5. Result Hook

**Pattern**: [Show the end result, then explain how]

**Examples**:
- "0 to 100K followers in 6 months. Here's how."
- "This one change tripled our conversion rate overnight."
- "From fired to $1M ARR in 18 months."

**Best for**: Case studies, tutorials, transformation stories

### 6. Problem-Agitate Hook

**Pattern**: [Name a pain point, then make it worse]

**Examples**:
- "Your landing page is losing customers. The fix isn't what you think."
- "You're wasting money on ads. And it's getting worse."
- "Your content strategy is broken. Here's why."

**Best for**: Solution-selling, consulting, problem-aware audiences

### 7. Curiosity Gap Hook

**Pattern**: [Reveal partial information that demands completion]

**Examples**:
- "One setting changed everything. 95% of people never touch it."
- "The secret ingredient nobody talks about."
- "What they don't tell you about passive income."

**Best for**: Listicles, secrets/tips content, insider knowledge

## 4-Part Script Framework

Universal structure for video, audio, and long-form written content:

### Part 1: Hook (First 3 seconds / First sentence)

**Elements**:
- Pattern interrupt (stop the scroll)
- Promise (what they'll get)
- Credibility (why you)

**Visual cues for video**:
- Contrast (bright vs dark, motion vs still)
- Extremes (close-up face, dramatic B-roll)
- Unexpected combinations (juxtaposition)

**Example**:
> "I spent $10K testing AI video tools. [VISUAL: Money burning] Only three are worth it. [VISUAL: Three product logos] Here's why."

### Part 2: Storytelling (Build engagement)

**Elements**:
- Context (why this matters)
- Stakes (what's at risk)
- Roadmap (what's coming)

**Pattern interrupts** (every 2-3 minutes for video, every 3-4 paragraphs for text):
- Curiosity gap: "But here's where it gets weird..."
- Story pivot: "That's what I thought too, until..."
- Direct address: "Now you might be thinking..."
- Visual change: [B-roll / graphic / screen change]
- Tease ahead: "And the third one is the one nobody expects..."
- Reframe: "But forget everything I just said, because..."

### Part 3: Soft Sell (Deliver value + position offer)

**Elements**:
- Solution presentation
- Proof (data, examples, demos)
- Implementation (how to apply)
- Subtle positioning (your product/service as accelerator)

**Soft sell techniques**:
- "This is what I use..." (not "you should buy")
- "If you want to go faster..." (optional upgrade path)
- "The free way vs the fast way" (value ladder)

### Part 4: Visual Cues (Maintain attention)

**For video**:
- B-roll every 3-5 seconds
- Text overlays for key points
- Graphics for data/comparisons
- Scene changes for section transitions

**For text**:
- Subheadings every 3-4 paragraphs
- Bold for key takeaways
- Lists for scannable content
- Blockquotes for emphasis

## Transformation Arc: Before/During/After

The most powerful narrative structure for any content type.

### Before (The Problem State)

**What to show**:
- Current pain points (in audience's exact language)
- Failed solutions they've already tried
- Emotional state (frustration, confusion, overwhelm)
- Stakes (what happens if nothing changes)

**Example**:
> "You're posting 3x per day, but engagement is flat. You've tried trending sounds, better captions, even paid ads. Nothing moves the needle. Meanwhile, your competitors are growing."

### During (The Journey)

**What to show**:
- The turning point (what changed)
- The method (step-by-step)
- Obstacles encountered (and overcome)
- Small wins along the way

**Example**:
> "Then I discovered the 80/20 rule for content. Instead of posting more, I posted less — but with 10x more research per post. First week: nothing. Second week: one post hit 50K views. Third week: three posts went viral."

### After (The Transformation)

**What to show**:
- Measurable results (numbers, screenshots, testimonials)
- Emotional state (confidence, clarity, relief)
- New capabilities unlocked
- What's now possible that wasn't before

**Example**:
> "Six months later: 100K followers, 3 brand deals, and I'm posting 5x per week instead of 21x. The difference? Every post is strategic, not random."

## Campaign Audit Process (7 Steps)

Use this framework to audit existing content or plan new campaigns.

### Step 1: Analyze Offer (Homework vs Value)

**Questions**:
- Does this require work from the audience? (homework)
- Or does it deliver immediate value? (value)
- Is the value > perceived effort?

**Rule**: Cold traffic needs low-homework offers. Warm traffic tolerates more homework.

**Examples**:
- **Low homework**: "Download this template" (good for cold)
- **High homework**: "Take this 30-day challenge" (warm/hot only)

### Step 2: Check Urgency

**Questions**:
- Why should they act NOW vs later?
- Is there a deadline? (real or artificial)
- Is there scarcity? (limited spots, seasonal, trending)
- Is there a consequence to waiting?

**Urgency types**:
- **Time-based**: "Offer ends Friday"
- **Quantity-based**: "Only 10 spots left"
- **Seasonal**: "Before Q4 buying season"
- **Trend-based**: "While this tool is still underpriced"

### Step 3: Analyze Pain Angle

**Questions**:
- Are you leading with pain or aspiration?
- Is the pain point specific enough?
- Are you using the audience's exact language?
- Have you agitated the pain sufficiently?

**Pain angle formula**:
1. Name the pain (specific, not generic)
2. Show the cost of inaction (what they're losing)
3. Agitate (make it worse)
4. Introduce solution

**Example**:
> "Your YouTube thumbnails are getting 2% CTR. Industry average is 8%. That means for every 100 impressions, you're losing 6 potential viewers. Over a year, that's 50K+ views you'll never get back. And it's not your fault — nobody teaches thumbnail psychology."

### Step 4: Cosmetic vs Life-Changing

**Questions**:
- Is this a "nice to have" or a "must have"?
- Does it solve a surface problem or a root problem?
- What's the real transformation?

**Cosmetic** (harder to sell):
- "Better looking website"
- "More organized inbox"
- "Prettier social media graphics"

**Life-changing** (easier to sell):
- "Website that converts 3x more leads"
- "Inbox system that saves 10 hours/week"
- "Graphics that drive 50% more engagement"

**Reframe cosmetic as life-changing**: Connect the surface benefit to the deeper outcome.

### Step 5: Audit Hook + Visual (First 3 Seconds)

**Video checklist**:
- [ ] Does the first frame stop the scroll? (contrast, motion, face)
- [ ] Does the first sentence create curiosity?
- [ ] Is there a visual + verbal hook alignment?
- [ ] Would you stop scrolling if you saw this?

**Text checklist**:
- [ ] Does the headline use a proven hook formula?
- [ ] Is it 6-12 words?
- [ ] Does it create a curiosity gap?
- [ ] Is it specific, not generic?

### Step 6: Implement All 4 Elements

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Hook (pattern interrupt + promise + credibility)
- [ ] Storytelling (context + stakes + roadmap)
- [ ] Soft sell (value + proof + positioning)
- [ ] Visual cues (B-roll / graphics / formatting)

**Common mistakes**:
- Hook without payoff (curiosity gap never closed)
- Storytelling without stakes (boring)
- Hard sell instead of soft sell (repels audience)
- No visual variety (attention drops)

### Step 7: Test and Measure

**Metrics by format**:

| Format | Primary Metric | Secondary Metrics |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Video (short-form) | Completion rate | Shares, saves, comments |
| Video (long-form) | Retention curve | CTR, watch time, subscribers |
| Blog post | Time on page | Scroll depth, bounce rate, conversions |
| Email | Open rate | Click rate, reply rate |
| Social post | Engagement rate | Saves, shares, profile visits |

**Testing discipline**:
- 10 variants minimum before judging
- 250-sample rule (need 250+ views/opens to validate)
- Below 2% = kill
- Above 2% = scale
- Above 3% = go aggressive

## Pain vs Aspiration Angle Selection

Choose your narrative angle based on audience awareness and market sophistication.

### Pain Angle (Problem-Aware Audience)

**When to use**:
- Audience knows they have a problem
- Market is saturated (need to agitate pain)
- High-ticket offers (need strong motivation)
- B2B / professional audiences

**Structure**:
1. Name the pain (specific)
2. Show the cost (what they're losing)
3. Agitate (make it worse)
4. Introduce solution
5. Show transformation

**Example**:
> "Your content is invisible. You're posting daily, but the algorithm ignores you. Every hour you spend creating is an hour wasted. Meanwhile, your competitors are growing. Here's why — and how to fix it."

### Aspiration Angle (Solution-Aware Audience)

**When to use**:
- Audience knows what they want
- Market is less saturated (differentiation matters)
- Low-ticket offers (impulse buys)
- Consumer / lifestyle audiences

**Structure**:
1. Paint the vision (where they want to be)
2. Show what's possible (proof)
3. Bridge the gap (how to get there)
4. Make it easy (remove friction)
5. Call to action

**Example**:
> "Imagine waking up to 1,000 new followers. No ads, no gimmicks — just content that resonates. It's happening for creators who understand one principle. Here's how to apply it."

### Hybrid Angle (Best of Both)

**Structure**:
1. Start with aspiration (hook)
2. Acknowledge pain (relatability)
3. Show the gap (what's missing)
4. Provide solution (bridge)
5. End with transformation (aspiration fulfilled)

**Example**:
> "You want 100K followers. But right now, you're stuck at 5K, posting daily with no growth. The gap isn't effort — it's strategy. Here's the exact system that took me from 5K to 100K in 6 months."

## Pattern Interrupt Principle

Attention resets every 8-15 seconds. Use pattern interrupts to maintain engagement.

### Contrast

**Visual**:
- Bright → Dark
- Close-up → Wide shot
- Still → Motion

**Verbal**:
- Loud → Quiet
- Fast → Slow
- Serious → Humorous

### Extremes

**Visual**:
- Extreme close-up (face, product detail)
- Extreme wide shot (landscape, context)
- Extreme color saturation

**Verbal**:
- Extreme claims ("This changed everything")
- Extreme specificity ("Exactly 47 seconds")
- Extreme simplicity ("Here's the truth")

### Unexpected Combinations

**Visual**:
- Juxtaposition (luxury car + humble setting)
- Anachronism (modern tech + vintage aesthetic)
- Scale mismatch (tiny object + huge background)

**Verbal**:
- Contradictions ("The best way to grow is to stop growing")
- Reversals ("What if you're doing it backwards?")
- Metaphor mismatch ("Marketing is like gardening, not hunting")

## Storytelling Frameworks

Choose based on content type and audience awareness.

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

**Best for**: Product reviews, tutorials, sales pages

**Structure**:
1. **Attention**: Hook with the problem or result
2. **Interest**: Why this matters to the viewer
3. **Desire**: Show the solution working (proof)
4. **Action**: CTA (subscribe, buy, try, comment)

**Example flow**:
> Hook: "This $20 tool replaced my $2,000 setup."
> Interest: "If you're spending hours on video editing, this matters."
> Desire: "Watch how I edited this entire video in 15 minutes."
> Action: "Link in description. Try it free for 30 days."

### Three-Act Structure

**Best for**: Documentaries, deep dives, long-form content

**Structure**:
1. **Setup**: Introduce the topic, establish stakes
2. **Confrontation**: Present the conflict/challenge/mystery
3. **Resolution**: Deliver the answer/solution/revelation

**Example flow**:
> Act 1: "AI video generation is exploding. But 95% of creators are using it wrong."
> Act 2: "I tested 47 tools over 6 months. Most produce garbage. Here's why."
> Act 3: "These 3 tools are the exception. Here's how to use them."

### Hero's Journey

**Best for**: Personal stories, transformations, case studies

**Structure**:
1. **Ordinary world**: Where you/subject started
2. **Call to adventure**: The challenge that appeared
3. **Trials**: What was tried, what failed
4. **Transformation**: The breakthrough moment
5. **Return**: What was learned, how it applies to audience

**Example flow**:
> Ordinary: "I was a 9-5 employee, dreaming of freedom."
> Call: "I got laid off. Had to figure out income fast."
> Trials: "Tried freelancing, failed. Tried dropshipping, failed."
> Transformation: "Then I discovered content arbitrage."
> Return: "Now I teach others the exact system."

### Problem-Solution-Result

**Best for**: How-to, educational, B2B content

**Structure**:
1. **Problem**: What's broken/missing/painful
2. **Failed approaches**: What doesn't work (and why)
3. **Solution**: The method that works
4. **Proof**: Evidence it works (data, examples, demos)
5. **Implementation**: Step-by-step for the audience

**Example flow**:
> Problem: "Your YouTube videos get views but no subscribers."
> Failed: "You tried better thumbnails, SEO, posting more. Didn't work."
> Solution: "The issue is your CTA. Here's the framework."
> Proof: "This channel went from 2% to 8% conversion using this."
> Implementation: "Step 1: End every video with this exact phrase..."

### Listicle with Stakes

**Best for**: "Top X" videos, roundups, comparison content

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Why this list matters (stakes)
2. **Items N through 2**: Build anticipation (save best for last)
3. **Item 1**: The most impactful/surprising entry
4. **Synthesis**: What the list reveals about the bigger picture

**Example flow**:
> Hook: "These 5 AI tools will replace entire teams in 2025."
> Items 5-2: [Countdown format, building tension]
> Item 1: "Number 1 is the one nobody's talking about yet."
> Synthesis: "What this means: AI is moving from assistant to replacement."

### Inverted Pyramid

**Best for**: News, updates, time-sensitive content

**Structure**:
1. **Most important**: Lead with the headline fact
2. **Supporting details**: Context and background
3. **Additional info**: Nice-to-know details
4. **Related**: Connections to other topics

**Example flow**:
> Lead: "OpenAI just released GPT-5. It's 10x faster."
> Details: "Released today, available to Plus subscribers."
> Additional: "New features include real-time voice, vision, and..."
> Related: "This changes the competitive landscape for..."

## "Proven First, Original Second" Strategy

The fastest path to effective content: copy structure, not content.

### The 3% Twist Rule

**Formula**:
1. Find proven content in your niche (high views/engagement)
2. Extract the structure (hook type, framework, pacing)
3. Apply to YOUR topic with YOUR voice
4. Add 3% originality (new data, unique angle, fresh examples)

**What to copy**:
- Hook formula (not the exact hook)
- Story structure (not the story)
- Pacing and pattern interrupts (not the specific interrupts)
- Visual style (not the exact visuals)

**What NOT to copy**:
- Exact phrases or sentences
- Specific examples or case studies
- Personal stories or anecdotes
- Brand-specific elements

### Remix Modes

| Mode | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Same topic, new angle** | Cover the same subject from a different perspective | "Why AI will replace designers" → "Why AI will never replace designers" |
| **Same structure, new topic** | Apply the successful format to a different subject | Viral video about productivity → Same structure for fitness |
| **Update** | Take an older video's topic and cover what's changed | "Best AI tools 2023" → "Best AI tools 2025" |
| **Response** | Create a response/reaction that adds your expertise | React to competitor's take with your contrarian view |
| **Deep dive** | Take one point from a broad video and go deeper | Broad: "10 AI tools" → Deep: "Complete guide to tool #3" |

### Validation Before Creation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Has this structure worked before? (proof of concept)
- [ ] Is my angle differentiated? (not just a copy)
- [ ] Do I have unique value to add? (expertise, data, story)
- [ ] Can I execute at the same quality level? (production value)
