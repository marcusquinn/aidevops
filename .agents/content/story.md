# Story - Narrative Design and Hook Engineering

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Craft platform-agnostic narratives that adapt to any media format or distribution channel
- **Input**: Research brief (from `content/research.md`) or topic + audience
- **Output**: Story package: hook variants, narrative arc, transformation framework, angle selection
- **Key Principle**: One story, many outputs -- design the narrative once, adapt everywhere

**Critical Rules**:

- **Hook-first always** -- Every output starts with the hook, regardless of platform
- **6-12 word constraint** on hooks -- Forces clarity and punch
- **Proven first, original second** -- 97% proven structure, 3% unique twist
- **One transformation per story** -- Before state -> struggle -> after state
- **Test 5-10 hook variants** before committing to any single angle

## Pre-flight Questions

Before committing to a narrative angle or hook, work through:

1. What is the theme — the universal truth this content explores?
2. What is the single takeaway — what should the audience think, feel, or do differently?
3. Does this tell a story — is there tension, transformation, and resolution?
4. Who is the protagonist — the audience, a character, or the brand — and is that the right choice?

## 7 Hook Formulas

Every piece of content starts with a hook. Use these formulas to generate variants:

| # | Formula | Example | Best For |
|---|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Bold Claim** | "95% of AI influencers will fail this year" | YouTube, blog, LinkedIn |
| 2 | **Question** | "Why do most AI creators quit in 6 months?" | Social, email, podcast |
| 3 | **Story** | "I spent $10K on AI tools and here's what happened" | YouTube, podcast, blog |
| 4 | **Contrarian** | "The AI tool everyone recommends is actually terrible" | X, Reddit, short-form |
| 5 | **Result** | "How I got 1M views using only free AI tools" | YouTube, short-form, social |
| 6 | **Problem-Agitate** | "You're wasting 4 hours/day on content that nobody sees" | Email, LinkedIn, blog |
| 7 | **Curiosity Gap** | "The one AI trick that changed everything (it's not what you think)" | Short-form, X, email |

**Hook generation process**:

1. Write 10 variants using different formulas
2. Score each on: specificity (1-5), emotion (1-5), curiosity (1-5)
3. Pick top 3 for A/B testing
4. Use the winner, archive the rest for future repurposing

## 4-Part Script Framework

Universal structure that works across all formats:

### 1. Hook (first 5-10 seconds / first sentence)

- Pattern interrupt or immediate value promise
- Use one of the 7 hook formulas
- Must work standalone (visible in previews, thumbnails, subject lines)

### 2. Storytelling (60-70% of content)

- **Before state**: Where the audience is now (pain, frustration, confusion)
- **Struggle**: The journey, failed attempts, common mistakes
- **After state**: The transformation, result, insight

Frameworks for the storytelling section:

- **AIDA**: Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action
- **Three-Act**: Setup -> Confrontation -> Resolution
- **Hero's Journey**: Ordinary world -> Call to adventure -> Return with knowledge
- **Problem-Solution-Result**: Pain -> Method -> Proof
- **Listicle with Stakes**: "5 mistakes that cost creators $10K+"

### 3. Soft Sell (15-20% of content)

- Transition naturally from story to offer/CTA
- Frame as logical next step, not sales pitch
- Use social proof or scarcity only if genuine

### 4. Visual Cues (embedded throughout)

- B-roll directions for video
- Image suggestions for blog/social
- Tone shifts for audio/podcast
- Formatting cues for text (bold, line breaks, emoji sparingly)

## Angle Selection

Choose the story angle based on audience state and platform:

| Angle | When to Use | Platforms |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Pain** | Audience is frustrated, searching for solutions | Blog, email, YouTube |
| **Aspiration** | Audience wants to level up, inspired by results | Short-form, social, YouTube |
| **Contrarian** | Audience follows conventional wisdom that's wrong | X, Reddit, podcast |
| **Educational** | Audience needs to learn a skill or concept | Blog, YouTube, podcast |
| **Hot take** | Audience is engaged in a trending conversation | X, short-form, Reddit |
| **Behind the scenes** | Audience wants authenticity and process | YouTube, podcast, social |

## Campaign Audit Process

Before publishing, validate the story package with this 7-step audit:

1. **Offer clarity** -- Can you explain the value in one sentence?
2. **Urgency** -- Is there a reason to act now (not manufactured)?
3. **Pain angle** -- Does it address a real, specific pain point?
4. **Cosmetic vs life-changing** -- Is this a nice-to-have or a must-have?
5. **Hook + visual alignment** -- Does the hook match the thumbnail/preview?
6. **4 elements present** -- Hook, story, soft sell, visual cues all included?
7. **Test readiness** -- Are there 3+ variants ready for A/B testing?

## Pattern Interrupt Principle

Hooks work by breaking the audience's scroll pattern. Three techniques:

1. **Contrast** -- Juxtapose unexpected elements ("The $0 tool that beats $500/month software")
2. **Extremes** -- Use specific, surprising numbers ("I analyzed 10,000 AI videos and found this")
3. **Unexpected combinations** -- Pair unrelated concepts ("What chess taught me about AI prompting")

## Story Package Output Format

When generating a story package, produce:

```text
# Story Package: [Topic]

## Hook Variants (scored)
1. [Hook] — Formula: [name] — Score: specificity/emotion/curiosity = total
2. ...
(minimum 5 variants)

## Narrative Arc
- Before state: [audience's current pain]
- Struggle: [common mistakes, failed approaches]
- Transformation: [the insight/method/result]
- After state: [where they'll be after consuming this content]

## Angle
- Primary: [angle name]
- Rationale: [why this angle for this audience]

## Script Skeleton (4-Part)
### Hook
[Winning hook variant]

### Story
[Scene-by-scene or section-by-section outline]

### Soft Sell
[CTA framing]

### Visual Cues
[B-roll / image / formatting directions]

## Platform Adaptation Notes
- YouTube: [specific adaptations]
- Short-form: [specific adaptations]
- Social: [specific adaptations]
- Blog: [specific adaptations]
- Email: [specific adaptations]
- Podcast: [specific adaptations]
