# Localhost — Redirected

This file has been merged into [`local-hosting.md`](local-hosting.md), which covers both the current `localdev-helper.sh` system and the legacy `localhost-helper.sh` commands.

Read `local-hosting.md` for:

- `.local` domain setup (dnsmasq + Traefik + mkcert)
- Port registry and collision detection
- Branch subdomains for worktrees
- Shared Postgres database management
- LocalWP MCP integration
- Legacy `localhost-helper.sh` CLI reference
