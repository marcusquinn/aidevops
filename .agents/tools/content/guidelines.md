# Content Persona Guidelines

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Adapt voice, tone, and format per platform while maintaining brand consistency
- **Workflow**: Draft core message -> adapt per platform -> cross-link -> schedule
- **Related**: `tools/social-media/bird.md`, `tools/social-media/linkedin.md`, `tools/content/content-calendar.md`

## LinkedIn Persona

**Tone**: Professional, authoritative, conversational where appropriate.

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Optimal length | 1300 characters (~200 words) for feed posts |
| Structure | Hook line -> insight -> supporting data -> CTA |
| Content types | Thought leadership, industry analysis, case studies, carousel docs |
| Hashtags | 3-5 relevant, mix niche + broad (e.g., `#DevOps #AIAutomation`) |
| Posting cadence | 3-5x/week, Tuesday-Thursday mornings perform best |

**Do**: Share original insights, tag people/companies, use line breaks for readability.
**Don't**: Use excessive emojis, cross-post tweets verbatim, ignore comments.

## Instagram Persona

**Tone**: Visual-first, approachable, behind-the-scenes authenticity.

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Caption length | 125-150 chars for feed (first line is hook), up to 2200 max |
| Hashtags | 20-30 per post, mix of sizes (5 large, 10 medium, 15 niche) |
| Stories | Daily, use polls/questions/countdowns for engagement |
| Reels | 15-60s, hook in first 3s, text overlays, trending audio |
| Carousel | 5-10 slides, educational content, save-worthy tips |

**Hashtag strategy**: Research via Explorer, rotate sets, save 5 groups of 30 in templates.
Place hashtags in first comment or end of caption (test both for reach).

## YouTube Persona

**Tone**: Educational, engaging, structured for retention.

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Title | 60 chars max, keyword-front-loaded, curiosity gap or number |
| Description | 200+ words, links in first 3 lines, keyword-rich summary |
| Timestamps | Required for 10min+ videos, improves SEO and retention |
| Tags | 10-15, mix broad + specific, include common misspellings |
| Thumbnails | High contrast, face + text overlay, consistent brand style |

**Description structure**:

```text
Line 1-3: Key links (website, social, mentioned tools)
Line 4-8: Video summary with target keywords
Line 9+: Timestamps, credits, affiliate disclosures
```

**Cards/End screens**: Add cards at natural transition points. End screen in final 20s with subscribe + related video.

## X/Twitter Persona

**Tone**: Concise, opinionated, conversational. Direct value or hot takes.

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Character limit | 280 (standard), 25,000 (Premium) |
| Thread strategy | 3-7 tweets, number them (1/5), hook in first tweet |
| Engagement hooks | Questions, polls, controversial takes, "unpopular opinion:" |
| Media | Images increase engagement 150%, native video > links |
| Hashtags | 1-2 max per tweet, integrated into sentence when possible |

**Thread template**: Hook (problem) -> Context -> Steps/Insights -> Summary -> CTA with link.

See `tools/social-media/bird.md` for X/Twitter API integration and automation.

## Blog/Website Persona

**Tone**: Long-form, authoritative, SEO-optimized.

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Word count | 1500-2500 for standard, 3000+ for pillar content |
| Structure | H2/H3 hierarchy, intro with hook, scannable subheadings |
| Internal linking | 3-5 internal links per post, contextual anchor text |
| Meta description | 150-160 chars, include primary keyword, compelling CTA |
| Structured data | Article schema, FAQ schema where applicable, breadcrumbs |

**SEO checklist**: Primary keyword in title + H1 + first 100 words + meta. Secondary keywords in H2s. Image alt text with keywords. URL slug under 60 chars.

## Cross-Platform Repurposing Workflow

Maximize content ROI by adapting one piece across platforms:

```text
Blog post (pillar)
  -> LinkedIn article excerpt (key insight + link)
  -> X/Twitter thread (3-5 key points)
  -> Instagram carousel (visual summary)
  -> YouTube video (deep dive or walkthrough)
  -> Instagram Reel / YouTube Short (single tip, 60s)
```

**Timing**: Stagger publication across 5-7 days. Blog first, social follows.

## Voice and Tone Consistency

Maintain brand identity across platforms while adapting format:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Core message | Same key insight, different packaging per platform |
| Vocabulary | Technical on LinkedIn/blog, simplified on Instagram/X |
| Personality | Consistent brand voice, adjusted formality per platform |
| Values | Always present regardless of platform constraints |

**Consistency check**: Before publishing, verify the core message is recognizable across all adapted versions. A reader following on multiple platforms should see coherence, not contradiction.
