# Auto-browse

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Use for**: Authorized browser operations, authenticated exports, workflow learning, and web data mining that should become repeatable.
- **Command**: `/auto-browse [instruction]`.
- **Workflow**: `.agents/workflows/auto-browse.md`.
- **Private state**: `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/auto-browse/<workflow-id>/`.
- **Promoted private agents**: `~/.aidevops/agents/custom/auto-browse/` after user review.
- **Shareable repo artifacts**: sanitized `todo/auto-browse/` plans only.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Mission

Use aidevops' existing browser, crawler, profile, and data-extraction tools to find the cheapest reliable path for a web task, then graduate the result into a reusable artifact.

Auto-browse is not a new browser engine. It is a controller that decides when to use fetch/API, curl-copy, sweet-cookie, Crawl4AI, WaterCrawl, Playwright, agent-browser, dev-browser, Playwriter, chromium-debug-use, Stagehand, browser-use, Skyvern, and profile/proxy tooling.

## Operating Principles

1. **Minimum agency first** — fetch/API/parser before browser; deterministic browser before AI/vision browser.
2. **Discover once, reuse often** — record endpoints, selectors, timing, auth, gotchas, and cheaper paths in `strategy.md`.
3. **Private by default for custom workflows** — account-specific agents, traces, downloads, cookies, profiles, and client notes stay under private aidevops user data.
4. **Sanitize before sharing** — repo `todo/` may contain only generalized plans and implementation tasks.
5. **Stop before irreversible impact** — final posting/payment/destructive/admin steps need explicit confirmation unless a bounded routine is pre-approved.

## Tool Router

| Task shape | First choice | Escalate when |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Public static data | Fetch/API/parser | HTML is dynamic, blocked, or incomplete |
| Many pages/docs/site audit | WaterCrawl/site-crawler/Crawl4AI | Login or heavy interaction required |
| Authenticated dashboard export | curl-copy/sweet-cookie/DevTools network | Endpoint cannot be isolated or action sequence required |
| Known form/navigation flow | Playwright/playwright-cli/agent-browser | Login persistence or extensions needed |
| Recurring logged-in workflow | dev-browser or persistent Playwright profile | User's live browser is required |
| Existing user session | chromium-debug-use or Playwriter | Flow must become CI-friendly/repeatable |
| Unknown/dynamic UI | Stagehand or browser-use | Vision-only/canvas/CAPTCHA-heavy path requires Skyvern |
| Profile/proxy/geo isolation | browser-profiles/proxy-integration | Only after explicit authorization |

## Artifact Rules

Private run folders may include exact selectors, account-specific workflows, traces, screenshots, downloads, profile metadata, and generated private agents. Repo artifacts must not include secrets, cookies, private account names, private client names, private local paths, or raw downloaded private data.

## Confirmation Matrix

| Action | Auto-browse behaviour |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Browse/read public page | Proceed after target is known |
| Login with stored/user-provided auth | Confirm credential source and profile policy |
| Create account/profile | Confirm before creation |
| Fill non-impact form | Proceed within stated scope |
| Final submit with legal/financial/client impact | Stop for confirmation |
| Post/comment/message/react/follow | Confirm exact content/target unless pre-approved routine |
| Payment/checkout/subscription | Stop before final payment action |
| Download private files | Confirm scope and private destination |
| Use proxy/VPN/anti-detect/CAPTCHA solver | Confirm legitimate authorization and record rationale |
| Extract personal/private data | Confirm minimum data scope and output handling |

## Graduation Output

Prefer this order:

1. API/fetch recipe and parser.
2. Crawler/extraction schema.
3. Deterministic Playwright/agent-browser helper.
4. Private workflow agent with profile policy.
5. High-agency fallback agent only when deterministic paths are not reliable.
6. Sanitized repo brief for framework-general improvements.

## Verification

Evidence must include the private `verification.md` path or sanitized command result. Do not report a workflow as reusable until a fresh run has verified the graduated path or the blocker is documented.
