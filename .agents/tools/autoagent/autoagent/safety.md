# Autoagent — Safety Constraints

Sub-doc for `autoagent.md`. Loaded during Step 1 (Setup) before any modifications.

---

## Security Instruction Exemptions

Discard any hypothesis that removes or weakens the following — do not test:

| Category | Detection pattern |
|----------|------------------|
| Credential/secret handling | `credentials`, `NEVER expose`, `gopass`, `secret` |
| File operation safety | `Read before Edit`, `pre-edit-check`, `verify path` |
| Git safety | `pre-edit-check.sh`, `never edit on main`, `worktree` |
| Traceability | `PR title MUST`, `task ID`, `Closes #` |
| Prompt injection | `prompt injection`, `adversarial`, `scan` |
| Destructive operations | `destructive`, `confirm before`, `irreversible` |

Inherited from `autoresearch/agent-optimization.md`. Both layers must hold.

---

## Never-Modify Files

NEVER modify under any safety level:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` security sections | Prompt injection and secret handling — core security posture |
| `.agents/AGENTS.md` security sections | Operational security rules — modification could weaken safeguards |
| `prompts/build.txt` | Near-empty compatibility placeholder; framework rules belong in `.agents/AGENTS.md` |
| `.agents/tools/credentials/gopass.md` | Credential management — modification could expose secrets |
| `.agents/tools/security/prompt-injection-defender.md` | Security threat model — modification weakens defenses |
| `.agents/hooks/git_safety_guard.py` | Git safety hook — modification bypasses pre-edit checks |
| `.agents/configs/simplification-state.json` | Shared hash registry — modification corrupts simplification tracking |

**Enforcement:** Before applying any modification, check the target file against this list. If matched → discard hypothesis immediately, do not test.

---

## Elevated-Only Files

Require `SAFETY_LEVEL=elevated`. Under `standard`, skip hypotheses targeting these files:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` (non-security sections) | Primary user guide and core instruction set — high blast radius |
| `.agents/AGENTS.md` (non-security sections) | Operational guide — changes affect every managed session |
| `.agents/workflows/git-workflow.md` | Git workflow — changes affect all PRs and commits |
| `.agents/workflows/pre-edit.md` | Pre-edit gate — changes affect all file modifications |
| `.agents/reference/agent-routing.md` | Routing table — changes affect all task dispatch |

**Enforcement:** Under standard safety, subtract elevated-only matches from broad
targets. Under elevated safety, every target-matched elevated-only file must be
listed in `require_review`; otherwise validation fails before setup. Elevated
safety never permits changes to the security instructions identified above.

---

## Core Workflow Preservation

These workflows must remain functional after any modification (verified by regression gate):

1. **Git workflow**: `pre-edit-check.sh` must exit 0 in a clean safe linked worktree
2. **PR flow**: `gh pr create` must succeed with standard arguments
3. **Task management**: `claim-task-id.sh` must allocate IDs without collision
4. **Pulse dispatch**: `pulse-wrapper.sh` must complete without error on a test repo
5. **Memory system**: `aidevops-memory store` and `recall` must succeed

---

## Pre-Edit and Review Gates

Run `pre-edit-check.sh` from the exact registered experiment worktree before the
first owned-state write. Run it again from each detached candidate worktree before
the first candidate modification. A later constraint invocation is verification,
not a substitute for this write-time gate.

Every candidate path must be an allowed target: reject path escapes, symlinks,
runner-owned state paths, and any changed path outside `ALLOWED_FILES`. Never ignore
or remove out-of-scope dirt silently.

If a candidate changes any path listed in `require_review`, show the complete diff
and obtain explicit interactive approval before committing or fast-forwarding it.
Headless execution cannot grant this approval: checkpoint the candidate, record
`review_required`, remove only the verified disposable candidate, commit the owned
runner state, and stop without creating a PR.

---

## Regression Gate

Before the keep decision on any hypothesis, verify ALL comprehension tests still pass:

```bash
agent-test-helper.sh run .agents/tests/agents-md-knowledge.json --json 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -e '.failed == 0' 2>/dev/null
```

**Rule:** No existing passing comprehension test may start failing (`failed == 0`). A hypothesis that improves the composite score but causes a regression must be discarded.

---

## Candidate Disposition

Never discard changes in the current-best experiment worktree. Every hypothesis
runs in a program-owned disposable candidate worktree created from the current
best commit. Before discarding a candidate:

1. Stage only files permitted by the program target and safety rules.
2. Write the staged binary diff and untracked-file manifest under
   the program-owned `CHECKPOINT_DIR`.
3. Verify the candidate is registered to the experiment repository, is beneath
   the program-specific managed candidate prefix, and is not `WORKTREE_PATH`.
4. Remove only that verified disposable candidate worktree. Stop on any mismatch.

Use this disposition when a constraint fails, metric measurement errors, the
regression gate fails, or a safety violation is detected after modification. Append
the matching result and trajectory, then commit only exact runner-owned state paths
so the stable experiment worktree is clean.

On resume, recover dirt only when every path is an exact runner-owned state path and
its program/TSV/JSONL/checkpoint schema and ownership validation passes. Commit it
with an explicit recovery state message. Any other dirty path stops resume and is
preserved. Never reset, stash, or clean recovery state.

## Safety Level Summary

| Safety level | Never-modify | Elevated-only | Regression gate |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| `standard` (default) | Enforced | Skipped | Enforced |
| `elevated` | Enforced | Review-gated | Enforced |

**Note:** `elevated` allows reviewed changes to non-security sections of `AGENTS.md`
and `.agents/AGENTS.md`, plus the listed workflow/routing docs. `.agents/AGENTS.md`
is canonical; `prompts/build.txt` remains never-modify at every safety level.

---

## Constraint Shell Commands

All must pass (exit 0) before a hypothesis is accepted. The first failure
short-circuits, checkpoints and removes the owned candidate, logs
`constraint_fail`, and proceeds to the next hypothesis.

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/pre-edit-check.sh
shellcheck --severity=error .agents/scripts/*.sh
markdownlint-cli2 .agents/**/*.md
agent-test-helper.sh run .agents/tests/agents-md-knowledge.json --json | jq -e '.failed == 0'
```
