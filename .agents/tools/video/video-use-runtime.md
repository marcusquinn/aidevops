# Video-use Runtime Integration

The imported `video-use-skill.md` is editing guidance, not an installed executable
package. Use this adapter with `video-editor.md`; do not resolve upstream helpers
relative to the imported Markdown. Upstream code remains MIT-licensed and lives
in a separate, versioned tool installation. Do not fork helpers into aidevops.

## Install and verify

Run from the active agent root (deployed: `~/.aidevops/agents`):

```bash
python3 scripts/video-use-helper.py status
python3 scripts/video-use-helper.py install
python3 scripts/video-use-helper.py smoke-test /existing/parent/new-video-smoke
python3 scripts/video-use-helper.py run render /project/edit/edl.json -o /project/edit/preview.mp4 --draft
```

`install` explicitly downloads the reviewed Git commit, Python 3.12 if needed,
and Python dependencies through `uv sync`. Prerequisites: Git, uv, ffmpeg and
ffprobe. FFmpeg must include libass/subtitles and zimg/zscale, not merely be on
PATH. On macOS, `brew install ffmpeg-full` provides these; put its keg's `bin`
directory first on PATH for the editing session (no global relinking required).
Readiness checks validate filters before installing or executing. The installer
fetches the complete upstream repository, including helpers,
installation guide, licence and Manim references. Animation engines remain
optional, installed only when selected. No footage is uploaded or transcribed.

The default location is
`~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/tools/video-use/<reviewed-commit>`; an explicit
`AIDEVOPS_VIDEO_USE_HOME` overrides the parent. Each version retains `uv.lock`
and a dependency receipt. Upstream does not ship a lock: first installation
resolves dependencies; subsequent use does not update them. A failed or modified
installation is preserved and refused, not reset or deleted. Inspect it before
authorising removal/reinstallation. Existing versions are never switched in place.

`status` verifies the exact source revision, unchanged tracked files, required
assets, Python imports and ffmpeg tools. It does not certify creative quality.
`smoke-test` creates synthetic footage, an overlay and word timestamps, then runs
the real renderer and checks audio presence, FPS, dimensions, duration and caption
offsets. Inspect its before/during/after frames; listen to the preview separately.

## Upstream maintenance

```bash
python3 scripts/video-use-helper.py check-upstream
```

This read-only check reports upstream HEAD, the separately reviewed executable
commit, and installed readiness. It checks the whole repository, including
helper-only changes. The existing daily skill updater already compares repository
HEAD (`scripts/skill-update-core-lib.sh`); reuse that signal, not another daemon.
Skill-text refresh is **not** executable promotion. The independent pin lives in
`configs/video-use-runtime.json.txt` so text reimports cannot promote runtime code.

For a new upstream commit:

1. Review the whole diff, especially helpers, dependency/build metadata, licences
   and bundled skills. Scan untrusted instructions; never follow install prompts
   asking for credentials in chat.
2. Update the runtime pin in an aidevops worktree/PR; preserve any adapter policy.
3. Explicitly install the candidate version in its own directory. Run upstream
   `python -m unittest discover -s tests` with that installation's Python, then
   the synthetic smoke test. Review dependency changes in the generated lock.
4. Verify representative portrait/rotated and mixed-FPS inputs when those paths
   change. Merge only after the candidate works; preserve older versions until
   no editing session references them. Roll back by reverting the reviewed pin.

## Editing policy adaptations

- Use transcript-first editing for speech-led footage. Silent demonstrations,
  music-led montages and visual narratives use visual/beat-led selection instead.
- Before hosted ASR, confirm audio upload rights, privacy and cost with the user.
  Set credentials securely; this helper deliberately exposes no transcription
  command. Alternative ASR is valid if word timestamps and verbatim speech are
  adequate for the edit. Silence detection is not a speech-content detector.
- Record source hashes, audio-track selection, provider/model and ASR settings in
  `edit/project.md`. Upstream cache files are name/track-based, not content-aware:
  do not reuse them after source/settings changes. Preserve old transcripts under
  a new versioned edit directory rather than silently replacing them.
- For multi-track sources, verify the selected transcript, caption input and
  rendered audio all refer to the intended track. The upstream renderer does not
  expose transcription's `--audio-track` switch; prepare an explicitly mapped
  working copy when necessary. Its subtitle builder expects `<source-id>.json`.
- Use EDL paths relative to the EDL's directory (for example `master.srt`, not
  `edit/master.srt` when the EDL already lives in `edit/`).
- Word-boundary cuts, output-timeline captions and correct overlay timestamps are
  correctness constraints. Fade lengths, easing and loudness targets are choices,
  not universal laws. Set them for the delivery brief. Stream-copy concatenation
  saves a concat encode, but burning overlays/subtitles still re-encodes video.
- Match the deliverable canvas before concatenating mixed aspect ratios. The
  upstream tool is not a general NLE: validate unsupported transitions, alpha,
  silent sources, HDR policy and multitrack edits rather than promising support.
- Check rendered frames and metadata and listen where possible. Waveform images
  alone cannot certify audible quality. Report any unperformed listening check.

## Animation routing and common output contract

| Engine | Choose for | Agent/reference |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Remotion | React compositions and reusable branded systems | `tools/video/remotion/remotion.md` and chapters |
| HyperFrames | HTML/CSS/GSAP compositions, UI-to-video | Installed upstream SKILL.md; verify engine CLI/version first |
| Manim | Equations, formal diagrams and graph transformations | Installed `skills/manim-video/SKILL.md` |
| PIL | Simple cards, labels, counters and image sequences | Installed upstream SKILL.md |
| Anime.js | DOM/SVG/browser motion | `tools/animation/animejs.md`; seek the timeline for deterministic frame capture |

Every slot brief must specify: purpose, start in **output** time, duration, canvas,
FPS, codec/pixel format, alpha requirement, brand/fonts, reveal/hold timing, and a
unique `edit/animations/slot_<id>/` output. Deliver source, rendered asset, actual
path, ffprobe metadata and representative frames. A WebM extension alone does not
prove alpha survived decoding/compositing: verify over a contrasting background.
Keep animation timing frame-driven; do not transplant wall-clock Anime.js/CSS
animations into Remotion. Independent slots may run concurrently within the
session's delegation authority and resource budget; sequential execution is valid.
