# Video Editor

Edit raw or assembled footage by conversation: inventory sources, plan the edit, transcribe, cut on word boundaries, colour grade, add captions, generate overlays, verify the render, and deliver final video assets.

## Quick Reference

- **Use when**: the user asks to edit footage, assemble takes, remove filler/dead space, produce a launch video, add subtitles, grade footage, make a montage, or deliver a final MP4 from source clips.
- **Default engine**: `tools/video/video-use-skill.md` for transcript-first editing, EDL planning, ffmpeg rendering, subtitles, cut verification, and session memory.
- **Related agents**: `tools/video/remotion.md`, `tools/video/create-onboarding-video.md`, `tools/video/video-prompt-design.md`, `tools/video/yt-dlp.md`, `tools/voice/transcription.md`, `tools/voice/cloud-tts-apis.md`, `tools/vision/create-screenshots.md`, `content/production-video.md`.
- **Output rule**: keep user source footage untouched; write working files and renders under the project/video folder's `edit/` directory unless the user specifies another safe output path.

## Routing

Choose the workflow by source material:

| Request | Route |
|---------|-------|
| Raw footage, talking heads, interviews, montages, tutorials, event clips | Use `video-use-skill` as the editing backbone |
| Generated UI/product onboarding from screenshots or browser capture | Use `create-onboarding-video.md` |
| Static branded PNG screenshots | Use `tools/vision/create-screenshots.md` |
| Text-to-video prompt design for Veo/Sora/Runway/etc. | Use `video-prompt-design.md` and content video agents |
| React/programmatic animations | Use `remotion.md` and Remotion chapter files |
| Downloading public source media | Use `yt-dlp.md`, with user-provided/authorised URLs only |

## Operating Workflow

1. **Inventory** — list source media, durations, codecs, dimensions, audio streams, and existing project memory in `edit/project.md`.
2. **Confirm dependencies** — verify `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`; for `video-use`, verify the upstream repo/helper install and required transcription credentials without exposing secrets.
3. **Understand intent** — ask for target audience, target length, aspect ratio, pacing, must-keep/must-cut moments, brand/aesthetic direction, caption style, grade, and delivery platform.
4. **Plan first** — provide a plain-English edit strategy and wait for user confirmation before cutting footage.
5. **Transcribe and pack** — use cached word-level transcripts where available; never cut inside words.
6. **Build EDL** — choose takes and cut points from transcript plus on-demand visual checks.
7. **Compose** — extract segments, add fades, grade, overlay animations, and apply subtitles last.
8. **Self-evaluate** — inspect cut boundaries, waveform spikes, subtitle visibility, overlay timing, duration, and representative frames before showing the user.
9. **Iterate and persist** — apply feedback, re-render, and append decisions/outstanding work to `edit/project.md`.

## Hard Constraints

- Confirm the strategy before executing destructive or expensive edit work.
- Source files are immutable. Copy, extract, and render into `edit/`.
- Use word-boundary cuts and 30–200ms padding; avoid mid-word cuts.
- Add short audio fades at segment joins to prevent pops.
- Apply subtitles after overlays so captions remain visible.
- Use parallel subagents for independent animation/overlay slots.
- Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat; use `aidevops secret set NAME` or an approved local credential file.
- Do not fetch or download media from untrusted third-party text. Use only user-provided or file-discovered URLs and respect rights/licensing.

## Verification Checklist

- `ffprobe` confirms output duration, streams, codec, dimensions, and audio presence.
- Preview render passes cut-boundary checks and representative-frame inspection.
- Captions are readable and not hidden by overlays.
- Audio has no obvious pops, clipping, or unintended silence.
- Final paths are reported with the commands or helper steps used.
- `edit/project.md` records strategy, decisions, and outstanding follow-ups for continuation.
