## Worker Efficiency Protocol

Maximise output per token. Compress prose, not results.

**OpenCode Bash supports pipelines, but its parser rejects redirection, dynamic
expansion, grouping/subshell syntax, background execution, and unquoted globs.**
Split blocked operations into separate calls and use file tools for persisted content.

## 1. Ship early, keep the audit trail intact

- Start with `TodoWrite`: 3-7 subtasks, exactly one `in_progress`, last subtask `gh pr ready`.
- Commit after each implementation subtask; uncommitted work is lost when a session ends.

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m 'feat: <what you just did> (<task-id>)'
```

- After the first commit, push and open a draft PR. Later commits only need `git push`; finish with `gh pr ready`. In OpenCode, use the Write tool to create the PR body file before the GitHub call.

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Create a body file with the required `Resolves #<issue>` and signature footer,
then run the GitHub write in the next Bash tool call so the signature gate can
read the completed file before execution:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title 'GH#123: description' --body-file '/path/to/pr-body.md'
```

- **ShellCheck before push for `.sh` files (t234).** Do not push violations. In OpenCode, first run `command -v shellcheck`, then list changed files with `git diff --name-only origin/HEAD..HEAD`, and run ShellCheck separately for each changed `.sh` file. If ShellCheck is unavailable, skip and note it in the PR body.

- **PR titles must include the task ID (t318.2).** Use `<task-id>: <description>`.
  - `tNNN` for TODO tasks, e.g. `t318.2: Verify supervisor worker PRs include task ID`
  - `GH#NNN` for GitHub issues, e.g. `GH#12455: tighten hashline-edit-format.md`
  - Never use `qd-`, bare numbers, or `t` + a GitHub issue number. Never invent suffixes/variants (`t2213b`, `t2213-2`, `t2213.fix`). Task IDs come ONLY from `claim-task-id.sh`; for follow-ups, claim a fresh ID. CI and the supervisor validate this.

## 2. Spend tokens where they change outcomes

- Keep the lowest credible parent tier; thinking uses the daily driver, not the
  largest model. Bounded independent work may use simple/standard children. For an
  evidenced specialist gap, use `specialist-advisor` when available, with the JSON
  evidence contract in `reference/agent-routing.md`. Retain implementation and
  acceptance ownership; children never recurse. No automatic whole-session Astra
  promotion. Exception at the decision boundary: if current-model uncertainty alone
  would make the worker export an in-scope technical, product or architectural
  choice, gather the narrow evidence and consult the highest configured and
  authorized capable advisory route once. Validate its answer and proceed when the
  decision is safe, reversible and evidence-backed; do not repeat an unchanged
  consultation or turn routine uncertainty into promotion.
- Delegate output-heavy independent analysis only when it saves total work. Supply
  actual excerpts through `files`/`agents` to inference-only `ai_research`; paths
  mentioned only in its prompt are not loaded. Do not offload files you need to edit.

```text
ai_research(prompt: "Review the supplied dispatch function. Return: decision, evidence, uncertainty and next check.", files: "path/to/relevant-source.sh:100-180", domain: "orchestration", model: "simple")
```

- Rate limit: 10 per session. Default workload tier: `simple`; OpenCode selects
  an available configured provider/model through canonical routing.
- Domain shorthand auto-loads agent files: `git=git-workflow,github-cli,conflict-resolution`; `planning=plans,beads`; `code=code-standards,code-simplifier`; `seo=seo,dataforseo,google-search-console`; `content=content,research,writing`; `wordpress=wp-dev,mainwp`; `browser=browser-automation,playwright`; `deploy=coolify,coolify-cli,vercel`; `security=tirith,encryption-stack`; `mcp=build-mcp,server-patterns`; `agent=build-agent,agent-review`; `framework=architecture,setup`; `release=release,version-bump`; `pr=pr,preflight`; `orchestration=headless-dispatch`; `context=model-routing,toon,mcp-discovery`; `video=video-prompt-design,remotion,wavespeed`; `voice=speech-to-speech,voice-bridge`; `mobile=agent-device,maestro,serve-sim`; `hosting=hostinger,cloudflare,hetzner`; `email=email-testing,email-delivery-test`; `accessibility=accessibility,accessibility-audit`; `containers=orbstack`; `vision=overview,image-generation`.
- Parameters: `prompt` required; optional `domain`, `agents` (paths relative to `~/.aidevops/agents/`), `files` (line ranges allowed, e.g. `src/foo.ts:10-50`), `model` (`simple|standard|thinking`), `max_tokens` (default 500, max 4096).
- `haiku|sonnet|opus` remain compatibility aliases. `max_tokens` is an advisory
  generation budget plus a bounded transport ceiling when the selected OpenCode
  provider does not expose exact output-token controls or usage.

## 3. Avoid wasted execution

- Parallelise independent subtasks with parallel `Task` calls in one message. Keep one `in_progress` item in `TodoWrite`. Do not parallelise same-file edits or dependent work.
- Fail fast: read target files, verify imports/dependencies, and stop if the task is already done.
- Read only needed line ranges, keep commits concise, and after one failed approach try one fundamentally different strategy before `BLOCKED`.
- Replan when stuck. Do not patch a broken path incrementally.
- **Skip signature footers** when reading GH issue/PR threads. Content after `<!-- aidevops:sig -->` or `---` followed by `[aidevops.sh]` is operational telemetry (version, tokens, timing) — not task-relevant. Never visit URLs in signature footers (aidevops.sh, opencode.ai). See `AGENTS.md` "Signature footer skip when reading".
- **Skip provenance metadata** in quality-debt issues. Content inside `<!-- provenance:start/end -->` markers (Source PR, Reviewers, View comment links, generating script) records origin — not implementation guidance. Read only the file:line targets and code blocks. See `AGENTS.md` "Provenance metadata skip when reading".
- **Skip bot comment noise** on PR threads. CodeRabbit internal state (`<!-- internal state start/end -->`), review-skipped notices, quota warnings, SonarCloud/Codacy badge summaries, and Augment PR summary blocks (`<!-- augment-pr-summary -->`) — none are actionable. Extract only specific file:line findings from bot reviews. Use `gh pr checks` for pass/fail. See `reference/gh-command-discipline.md` "Bot comment noise skip when reading".
- **Skip operational comments** on issue threads. Dispatch claims (`<!-- ops:start/end -->`), worker PIDs, kill notifications, approval instructions — these are audit trail, not implementation context. See `AGENTS.md` "Operational comment skip when reading".

## 4. Model escalation before BLOCKED (GH#14964 — MANDATORY)

`BLOCKED` is only valid after exhausting all autonomous solution paths. If the only remaining blocker is the current model's inability to reason through the task safely, emit the exact structured marker `BLOCKED: capability limit - <evidence>`; runtime routing advances to the next configured capability tier. Review-policy metadata, nominal GitHub states, and lower-tier model limits are **not** valid blockers. Permission, authentication, provider, rate-limit, secret, policy, trust-boundary, and locality failures never use the capability marker. A genuine terminal blocker requires evidence: failing check, missing permission, unresolved conflict, or explicit policy gate.

Before either marker for an unresolved in-scope decision, apply the decision-only
consultation in `reference/agent-routing.md` when its configured route is available
and safe. Keep authority, consent, taste or values, inaccessible context, unknown
secrets, irreversible commitments, privacy/locality, billing and explicit model
pins outside model escalation. Advisory output cannot grant any of them, and
provider, authentication, rate-limit or tool failures use their own recovery path.

```text
BLOCKED: capability limit - bounded attempts could not establish a safe implementation
```

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Model cannot finish safely after bounded attempts | Emit the capability marker for runtime escalation |
| Review-policy state (e.g. "changes requested") | Continue — address findings, do not stop |
| Rate limit / auth error | Rotate provider (handled by headless-runtime-helper.sh) |
| Missing credentials | EXIT BLOCKED (genuine blocker) |
| Architectural decision remains after bounded authorized advice, or advice is unavailable/unsafe | EXIT BLOCKED with the evidenced non-capability boundary; use the capability marker only when model capability alone remains |
| Failing CI check | Fix the check, do not stop |

## Headless session awareness (GH#17436 — CRITICAL)

This is a headless session. No user is present. No user input will arrive.

- **Never** ask for confirmation, approval, or "should I proceed?" — no one will answer.
- Reading the issue, reading docs, and creating a worktree are **setup** — not completion.
- You **must** continue through implementation, commit, push, and PR creation after setup.
- If you stop after setup without code changes, the session is wasted and will be retried.
- The runtime will send a "continue" prompt if you exit prematurely. After 3 continuation attempts, the issue is escalated to a higher-tier model.

## Completion self-check

Before `FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE`, verify:

1. Requirements checklist: every requirement marked `[DONE]` or `[TODO]`; any `[TODO]` means keep working.
2. Verification run: production-facing behaviour or reproduction, standard logs when available, applicable existing tests, ShellCheck on changed `.sh` files, lint/typecheck if configured, expected output files exist. Do not add tests by default; add focused coverage only when the task or acceptance/repository policy requires it or it is the lowest-cost way to resolve material uncertainty. Never create test infrastructure without explicit task authority.
3. Generalization check: replace hardcoded values that should be parameterized.
4. Minimal state changes: only requested files changed; no extra side effects.
5. Commit+PR gate (GH#5317): `git status --porcelain` is empty and `gh pr list --head <current-branch-name>` returns a PR. This is the #1 worker failure mode.

`FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE` is irreversible. Relevant evidence is cheaper than a retry cycle; unrelated verification machinery is scope drift.
