   - Before creating files or directories, verify the exact intended parent path relative to the command's workdir (or use an absolute path).
   - When only existence and directory type are needed, use a bounded check such as \`test -d "foo"\` before \`mkdir "foo/bar"\`. Exit 0 confirms a directory; failure must stop creation. This does not enumerate children.
   - A successful check does not establish that an arbitrary existing directory is the correct parent: confirm the intended location from task context first. Quote paths, including paths with spaces.
   - When child names are materially needed, use an appropriately scoped directory listing or dedicated Read operation instead.
   - These checks do not grant filesystem access or replace pre-edit Git checks, destructive-operation confirmation, or other permission controls.`;
