## Done

- [x] t069 Fix toon-helper.sh validate command #bugfix ~15m actual:10m logged:2026-01-24 completed:2026-01-25
  - Notes: Fixed - validate command now correctly receives input_file via $arg2 from case statement. Verified code at lines 437-442 properly passes arguments.
- [x] t010 Evaluate Merging build-agent and build-mcp into aidevops #plan ~4h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: Decision: Keep as subagents in tools/ (not merge into aidevops.md). Implemented in v2.41.0 - generate-opencode-agents.sh cleans up old files, architecture.md documents the pattern.
- [x] t018 Enhance Plan+ and Build+ with OpenCode's Latest Features #plan ~3h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: All 4 phases complete. 1) Disabled built-in build/plan agents. 2) Set Plan+ as default_agent. 3) Added granular bash permissions for file discovery (git ls-files, fd, rg --files). 4) Updated generate-opencode-agents.sh. PR #123 merged.
- [x] t065 Fix postflight warnings: SonarCloud critical issues + OpenCode Agent workflow #bugfix #quality ~2h actual:30m logged:2026-01-17 started:2026-01-18T18:00Z completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: SonarCloud quality gate was already OK. Fixed OpenCode Agent workflow failing on `pull_request_review_comment` events due to `context.payload.issue` being undefined. Now uses `context.payload.pull_request` as fallback and appropriate API methods for PR review comments. PR #121 merged.
- [x] t001 Add TODO.md and planning workflow #workflow ~2h actual:1.5h logged:2025-12-18 completed:2025-12-20
- [x] t002 Add shadcn/ui MCP support #tools ~1h actual:45m logged:2025-12-18 completed:2025-12-18
- [x] t003 Add oh-my-opencode integration #tools ~30m actual:25m logged:2025-12-18 completed:2025-12-18
- [x] t011 Demote wordpress.md from main agent to subagent #architecture ~1h actual:45m logged:2025-12-21 started:2025-12-22T04:10Z completed:2025-12-22
- [x] t022 Move wordpress from root to tools/wordpress #refactor ~30m actual:25m logged:2025-12-22 started:2025-12-22T05:15Z completed:2025-12-22
- [x] t019 Beads Integration for aidevops #plan #beads ~2d actual:1.5d logged:2025-12-21 started:2025-12-21T16:00Z completed:2025-12-22
