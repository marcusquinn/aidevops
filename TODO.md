  - [ ] t199.4 Create content/production/image.md — AI image gen, thumbnails, style libraries ~45m assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T00:08:01Z
    - Notes: MUST INCLUDE: (1) Nanobanana Pro JSON prompt schema (4 template variants: editorial, environmental, magazine cover, street photography) with full JSON structure. (2) Style Library System (save working JSON as named templates, reuse with subject/concept swap, categorize by aesthetic).

(4) Shotdeck reference library workflow (find cinematic reference -> Gemini reverse-engineer composition/lighting/color -> prompt). (5) Tool routing: Nanobanana Pro for structured JSON, Midjourney for objects/environments (--ar 16:9 --style raw), Freepik for character-driven scenes, Seedream 4 for 4K refinement, Ideogram for face swap. (6) Thumbnail factory pattern (style template + topic concept = consistent thumbnails at scale). (7) Hex color code precision, camera settings in prompts, texture descriptions.
  - [ ] t199.5 Create content/production/video.md — Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Higgsfield, seed bracketing ~45m assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T00:13:11Z
    - Notes: MUST INCLUDE: (1) Sora 2 Pro 6-Section Master Template (header with 7-param style definition, shot-by-shot breakdown with cinematography 5-point spec, timestamped actions at 0.5s intervals, dialogue with delivery style, background sound, technical specs footer). (2) Veo 3.1 Ingredients-to-Video workflow (upload face/product as ingredients, NOT frame-to-video which produces grainy yellow output). (3) Model routing decision tree: Sora 2 for UGC/authentic/<10k production value, Veo 3.1 for cinematic/character-consistent/>100k production value. (4) Seed bracketing method (test seeds 1000-1010, score on composition/quality/style, pick winners, iterate -- references t202). (5) Content-type seed ranges: people 1000-1999, action 2000-2999, landscape 3000-3999, product 4000-4999, YouTube 2000-3000.

  - [ ] t199.6 Create content/production/audio.md — voice pipeline, sound design, emotional cues ~30m assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T00:16:54Z
    - Notes: MUST INCLUDE: (1) Voice pipeline: CapCut AI voice cleanup FIRST (normalize accents/artifacts), THEN ElevenLabs transformation (never direct from AI output -- references t204). (2) Emotional block cues (per-word emotion tagging for natural AI speech delivery). (3) 4-layer audio design (dialogue, ambient noise, SFX, music). (4) LUFS levels for different content types (dialogue -15, ambient -25). (5) Platform audio rules: UGC = all diegetic, commercial = mixed diegetic + score. (6) Voice cloning workflow for consistent channel narration. (7) References tools/voice/speech-to-speech.md, voice-helper.sh.
  - [ ] t199.7 Create content/production/characters.md — facial engineering, character bibles, personas ~30m assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T00:17:44Z
    - Notes: MUST INCLUDE: (1) Facial Engineering Framework (exhaustive facial analysis prompt covering bone structure, skin texture, eye details, hair, expressions -- enables consistency across 100+ outputs). (2) Character Bible template (face, personality, speaking style, wardrobe, backstory, catchphrases).

(5) Veo 3.1 Ingredients (upload face as ingredient for cross-scene consistency). (6) Nanobanana character JSON (save subject details as reusable template). (7) Brand identity consistency (color palette, lighting, post-processing as constants across all outputs). (8) "Model recency arbitrage" -- always use latest-gen model, older outputs get recognized as AI faster.
  - [ ] t199.8 Create content/distribution/ reference agents (youtube, short-form, social, blog, email, podcast) ~45m assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T00:31:31Z
    - Notes: MIGRATION: Move .agents/youtube.md and .agents/youtube/ from root into content/distribution/youtube/ — YouTube is a distribution channel, not a main agent. Root .agents/ is reserved for main domain agents only. MUST INCLUDE: (1) youtube.md reference -> migrated youtube/ subagents. (2) short-form.md: TikTok/Reels/Shorts formatting (9:16, 1-3s cuts, hook-first), platform-specific pacing, trending sound pairing. (3) social.md reference -> existing tools/social-media/ + platform-native tone adaptation (X concise, LinkedIn professional, Reddit community-native). (4) blog.md reference -> existing seo/ for SEO writing. (5) email.md: newsletter structure, sequence design. (6) podcast.md: audio-first distribution, show notes generation. (7) Monetization routing: affiliates first (market research), then info products ($5-27 cold traffic), then upsell. Q4 seasonality for buying intent. (8) Update all cross-references (AGENTS.md, subagent-index.toon, youtube-helper.sh) to new paths after migration.
  - [ ] t199.9 Create content/optimization.md — A/B testing, variant generation, analytics loops ~30m
    - Notes: MUST INCLUDE: (1) A/B testing discipline: 10 variants minimum, 250-sample rule before judging, below 2% = kill, above 2% = scale, above 3% = go aggressive. (2) Hook variant generation (5-10 per topic before committing). (3) Seed bracketing as optimization (references t202). (4) Slide/scene-level retention analysis (which specific moments retain vs cause drop-off). (5) "Proven first, original second" iteration strategy. (6) Rapid Testing Framework (B-roll + voice clone + script variants for fastest iteration). (7) Platform-specific metrics (YouTube: CTR, retention, watch time; TikTok: completion rate, shares; Blog: time on page, scroll depth). (8) Content calendar with posting cadence recommendations. (9) Analytics feedback loop (what worked -> inform next research cycle).
  - [ ] t199.10 Rewrite content.md orchestrator + update subagent-index.toon + AGENTS.md ~45m
    - Notes: content.md becomes the multi-media multi-channel orchestrator. Must describe: the diamond pipeline (Research -> Story -> fan-out to Production media -> fan-out to Distribution channels), the multi-media multiplier (one story -> 10+ outputs), how to invoke each sublayer. Update subagent-index.toon with all new content/ entries. Update AGENTS.md progressive disclosure table with Content row.
  - [ ] t199.11 Verify cross-references, ShellCheck, create PR ~30m
- [x] t200 Evaluate and import Veo 3 Meta Framework as aidevops skill #feature #content #video ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) ref:GH#821 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.5 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: github.com/snubroot/Veo-3-Meta-Framework referenced in 5+ content creation guides as the standard prompt engineering framework for Veo 3/3.1. Clone, evaluate structure, import via `aidevops skill add` if suitable. Would live alongside tools/video/video-prompt-design.md and be referenced by content/production/video.md.
- [x] t201 Transcript corpus ingestion for channel competitive intel #feature #content #youtube ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#822 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.1 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: Automate the "Creator Brain Clone" pattern: bulk download competitor channel transcripts via yt-dlp-helper.sh, store in memory-helper.sh with youtube namespace, enable queryable competitive knowledge base. Extends youtube/channel-intel.md and content/research.md. Key insight from PDF extraction: transcript corpus is the highest-leverage competitive intelligence source, more valuable than metadata alone.
- [ ] t202 Seed bracketing automation for AI video generation #feature #content #video ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#823 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.5
  - Notes: Script that systematically tests seed ranges (e.g. 1000-1010) per prompt, scores outputs via vision model, returns top candidates. Cuts AI video generation costs by ~60% (success rate 15% -> 70%+). Content-type seed ranges: people 1000-1999, action 2000-2999, landscape 3000-3999, product 4000-4999. YouTube-optimized: 2000-3000. Could be a new video-gen-helper.sh or extension of existing tools/video/ tooling. Referenced by content/production/video.md and content/optimization.md.
- [ ] t203 AI video generation API helpers (Sora 2 / Veo 3.1 / Nanobanana Pro) #feature #content #video #image ~4h (ai:3h test:1h) ref:GH#824 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199
  - Notes: CLI helper scripts for programmatic access to AI generation APIs, enabling pipeline automation beyond manual UI use. Sora 2 Pro for UGC-style (API via kie.ai or direct), Veo 3.1 for cinematic (ingredients-to-video, NEVER frame-to-video), Nanobanana Pro for structured JSON image gen. Each would follow the existing helper pattern (auth, generate, status, quota). Currently these tools are used via Higgsfield agent and browser; API helpers add headless pipeline optionality. Related: tools/video/higgsfield.md, tools/vision/image-generation.md, content/production/video.md, content/production/image.md.
- [ ] t204 Voice pipeline helper — CapCut cleanup + ElevenLabs transformation chain #feature #content #audio ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) ref:GH#825 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.6
  - Notes: Extend voice-helper.sh or create voice-pipeline-helper.sh for the 2-step voice post-processing chain: (1) CapCut AI voice cleanup (normalize accents/artifacts from raw AI output), (2) ElevenLabs voice cloning/transformation. Critical: never go directly from AI video output to ElevenLabs — the CapCut step cleans artifacts first. Also supports emotional block cues (per-word emotion tagging) for natural AI speech. Related: tools/voice/speech-to-speech.md, tools/voice/voice-bridge.md, content/production/audio.md.
- [ ] t206 Multi-channel content fan-out orchestration — one story to 10+ outputs #feature #content #pipeline ~3h (ai:2h test:1h) ref:GH#829 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199
  - Notes: The core multiplier capability: given one researched story (from content/research.md + content/story.md), automatically generate adaptation briefs for each target channel and media format. Example: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail" -> YouTube long-form script + YouTube Short + blog post outline + X thread + LinkedIn article + Reddit post + newsletter + carousel brief. Each adaptation uses the same hooks/angles but reformats for platform conventions. Orchestration logic lives in content.md, individual adaptations dispatched to content/distribution/ agents. This is the highest-leverage feature of the entire content creation system.
- [ ] t207 Thumbnail A/B testing pipeline — generate and test multiple thumbnail variants per video #feature #content #optimization ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#830 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.4,t199.9
  - Notes: Automated pipeline: (1) script-writer outputs key visual moments, (2) image.md generates 5-10 thumbnail variants using style library templates, (3) optimizer scores variants (text readability, face prominence, contrast, emotion), (4) optionally A/B test via YouTube API or manual upload. Uses Nanobanana Pro JSON for consistent brand style across variants. References content/production/image.md and content/optimization.md.
- [ ] t208 Content calendar and posting cadence engine #feature #content #pipeline ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) ref:GH#831 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199 related:t199.9
  - Notes: Schedule-aware content planning: (1) maintain a content calendar in memory or SQLite with planned topics, target dates, channels, status. (2) Posting cadence recommendations per platform (YouTube 2-3/week, Shorts daily, blog 1-2/week, social daily). (3) Q4 seasonality awareness for monetization-focused content. (4) Backlog management: research queue -> scripted queue -> produced queue -> scheduled queue -> published. (5) Analytics feedback: what performed well informs next cycle's topic selection. Could be a content-calendar-helper.sh or extension of existing pipeline.
- [ ] t209 YouTube slash commands — /youtube setup, /youtube research, /youtube script #feature #youtube #commands ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#832 logged:2026-02-09 blocked-by:t199
  - Notes: Interactive commands for YouTube workflow: (1) /youtube setup — store channel handle + competitors + niche in memory, configure API credentials. (2) /youtube research @competitor — run channel-intel + topic-research pipeline, store results in memory. (3) /youtube script "topic" — generate full script using script-writer.md frameworks with research context. Add to .agents/scripts/commands/. References youtube.md, youtube-helper.sh.

- [x] t195 Supervisor evaluate_worker PR validation — verify PR title/branch contains task ID before attributing #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#814 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T22:46:42Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: evaluate_worker() fallback PR detection (line ~4639) uses `gh pr list --head` to find PRs matching the task's branch. If the branch column in the DB is corrupted (e.g., t194's branch was recorded as feature/t020.6), the wrong PR gets attributed to the wrong task, causing false completion. Fix: after finding a PR via branch match, verify the PR title contains the task ID. If not, log a warning and skip. Discovered when t020.6 was falsely marked complete with t194's PR #810.
- [x] t196 Fix RETURN trap clobbering in trap cleanup scripts #bugfix #quality #shell ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#815 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T22:46:55Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: CodeRabbit review on PR #801 (t135.9) identified that `trap 'rm -f "$tmp"' RETURN` clobbers existing RETURN traps and can fail with `set -u` when the local temp var goes out of scope. Fix: save previous RETURN trap, install new trap that chains cleanup + restore, apply to all mktemp/trap pairs in supervisor-helper.sh (lines 3367, 3397, 4374, 7412, 7947) and setup.sh (line 2590). Pattern: `_prev=$(trap -p RETURN); trap 'rm -f "$tmp"; eval "$_prev"' RETURN`.
- [ ] t197 Worktree registry prune command — clean dead/corrupted entries #chore #git ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) ref:GH#816 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T22:47:06Z logged:2026-02-09
  - Notes: worktree-helper.sh registry has 70+ dead entries including corrupted entries with ANSI escape codes and temp directory test entries from /var/folders/. Add `registry prune` command that removes entries where: (1) PID is dead AND path doesn't exist, (2) path contains ANSI escape codes, (3) path is in /tmp or /var/folders (test artifacts). Currently `clean` only handles merged branches, not registry hygiene. BLOCKED: Max retries exceeded: clean_exit_no_signal
- [ ] t198 Investigate clean_exit_no_signal retry pattern — root cause analysis #bugfix #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#817 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T23:30:56Z logged:2026-02-09
  - Notes: Multiple tasks (t072, t132, t134, t135.3-6, t166.2, t181, t182, t184, t191) repeatedly fail with clean_exit_no_signal, burning 3 retries each at Opus cost. Memory shows this is the #1 failure pattern. Possible causes: (1) OpenCode exits 0 even on backend errors, (2) workers complete but don't emit WORKER_COMPLETE signal, (3) workers hit context limits and exit gracefully. Need to analyze log patterns across these failures and add better signal detection or worker instrumentation.
- [x] t194 Daily model registry refresh — detect new/changed model IDs from OpenCode providers #feature #supervisor #model-routing ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#798 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T20:46:06Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: On session start or daily cron, run `opencode models` and compare against hardcoded IDs in supervisor-helper.sh and fallback-chain-config.json.txt. Flag mismatches (new models, deprecated IDs). Also fix model-availability-helper.sh to use `opencode models <provider>` instead of direct API key probing (which fails because OpenCode manages keys internally). Related: PR #796 fixed stale model IDs and openrouter fallback.
- [x] t200 Fix SC2012 in review-pulse-helper.sh — replace `ls` with `find`/`fd` for file discovery #quality #shell ~15m (ai:10m test:5m) ref:GH#821 logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #818 merged
  - Notes: CodeRabbit pulse review (issue #753) found 3 instances of `ls` where `find` should be used (SC2012). Lines 378, 451 use `ls -t` to find latest findings file; line 555 uses `ls | wc -l` to count files. Replace with `find`+`sort` or `fd` patterns. Other CodeRabbit findings (SC2086 in wp-helper.sh, SC2034 unused colors) were verified as false positives. Originally t196, renumbered to t200 due to parallel session collision.
- [x] t205 Add AGENTS.md rule: re-verify task ID after git pull --rebase before push #docs #workflow #quality ~15m (ai:10m) logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #820 merged
  - Notes: Race condition hit twice in one session — parallel sessions created t195 and t196 simultaneously, causing duplicate IDs in TODO.md. Root cause: agent assigns next ID, commits, push fails, does pull --rebase, pushes again WITHOUT re-checking if the ID is still free. Fix: added rule to AGENTS.md Planning & Tasks section. Originally t201, renumbered to t205 due to parallel session collision (ironic).
- [x] t189 Worktree ownership safety — prevent sessions from removing worktrees owned by other parallel sessions #bugfix #git #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#692 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:24:23Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #695 merged
  - [x] t189.1 Add worktree ownership registry ~45m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: When a session creates or claims a worktree, register it in a SQLite table or lockfile: worktree path, session ID, PID, task ID, created timestamp. Before removing any worktree, check the registry — if another session owns it and its PID is still alive, REFUSE to remove. If PID is dead but session is recent (<1h), WARN and require --force. This prevents the exact bug that happened: supervisor session cleaned up a worktree that a parallel interactive session was actively using.
  - [x] t189.2 Add "in use" detection to worktree cleanup ~30m blocked-by:t189.1
    - Notes: Before `git worktree remove`, check: (1) is any process with CWD inside the worktree? (`lsof +D` or `fuser`), (2) is the worktree registered to another session?, (3) are there uncommitted changes? Only remove if all three are clear. Add --force to override (with warning). Wire into supervisor cleanup, `wt merge`, and any other worktree removal paths.
  - [x] t189.3 Add AGENTS.md rule: never remove worktrees you didn't create ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Immediate instruction-level fix. Add to AGENTS.md: "NEVER remove a worktree unless (a) you created it in this session, (b) it belongs to a task you are managing, or (c) the user explicitly asks. Worktrees may belong to parallel sessions — removing them destroys another agent's working directory." This is the cheapest fix and should be done first.
  - [x] t189.4 Scope batch cleanup to batch-owned worktrees only ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: The supervisor's worktree cleanup during pulse should ONLY touch worktrees for tasks in the current batch. Currently it can discover and remove any worktree matching the naming pattern. Add batch_id filtering: only clean worktrees whose task_id is in the batch being pulsed.
  - Notes: Root cause from 2026-02-09: supervisor session force-removed a worktree (`bugfix/setup-template-opencode-install`) that belonged to a parallel interactive session. The branch survived but the other session lost its working directory and had to restart. Git workflow protects code (branches survive), but the worktree directory is the active workspace — losing it mid-session is disruptive. Three layers of fix needed: (1) instruction-level rule (t189.3, cheapest), (2) ownership registry (t189.1, most robust), (3) in-use detection (t189.2, defense in depth).
- [x] t187 Compaction-resilient session state — ensure critical context survives LLM context compaction #feature #framework #self-improvement ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#686 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:59:21Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #699 merged
  - [x] t187.1 Add compaction survival instruction to AGENTS.md/build.txt ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Add an instruction that is always preserved through compaction summaries. Something like "When summarizing this conversation for compaction, ALWAYS include: current batch ID, active task IDs and their states, worktree paths, and the next 3 action items." This ensures the model retains operational state even after aggressive compaction. Test by verifying the instruction appears in compaction output.
  - [x] t187.2 Add session-state checkpoint command ~1h blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Create a `/checkpoint` command that outputs a structured continuation prompt (like the one used to resume this session). Format: batch state, task statuses, worktree list, open PRs, next steps, user preferences. Can be auto-generated at session end or on demand. Store in memory for cross-session recall. This is the single highest-impact factor for session continuity through compaction.
  - [x] t187.3 Enhance session-distill to capture operational state ~30m blocked-by:t187.2
    - Notes: Current session-distill captures learnings but not operational state (which tasks are running, what PRs need review). Extend to also emit a checkpoint block that can be fed back as a continuation prompt.
  - Notes: Lesson from 2026-02-09 session: continuation prompt was the single biggest factor in surviving compaction. AGENTS.md provides the "how" (conventions, tools), but the continuation prompt provides the "where we are" (task states, batch IDs, next steps). Without it, the agent can operate the framework but doesn't know what to work on. Tool outputs (supervisor status, git log, gh pr list) can partially reconstruct state but are slower and lossy.
- [x] t188 Pre-migration safety backups for non-git state — backup DBs and local state before destructive operations #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#687 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:41:26Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #697 merged
  - [x] t188.1 Add automatic backup before schema migrations ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: The t180 migration already calls backup_db() but the INSERT INTO tasks SELECT * FROM tasks_old_t180 silently failed, leaving the tasks table empty. Need: (a) verify row count after migration matches before, (b) rollback if mismatch, (c) keep backup until next successful pulse confirms data integrity. The backup existed and saved us — but the migration should have caught its own failure.
  - [x] t188.2 Add backup-before-modify pattern for non-git state ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Git workflow protects code files, but SQLite DBs, memory stores, and config files aren't version-controlled. Pattern: before any destructive operation on non-git state (schema migration, bulk prune, consolidate), create a timestamped backup, verify the operation succeeded, and only clean up the backup after the next successful operation confirms integrity. This is what saved the supervisor DB today — the backup_db() call in the migration created a restore point.
  - [x] t188.3 Add backup cleanup on successful verification ~15m blocked-by:t188.1
    - Notes: Backups accumulate. After a successful pulse confirms task data is intact (row count matches batch_tasks), clean up backups older than 24h. Keep the most recent backup always.
  - Notes: Lesson from 2026-02-09: t180 schema migration emptied the tasks table (INSERT from renamed table silently failed). The backup_db() call saved us — we restored 60 tasks from the pre-migration backup. Git workflow wouldn't have caught this because SQLite DBs are gitignored. Non-git state needs its own safety net.
- [x] t186 Add development lifecycle enforcement to AGENTS.md — all work must create TODO entry and either full-loop or queue for runners #docs #workflow #quality ~30m (ai:20m) ref:GH#682 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T01:08:14Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #700 merged
  - Notes: Development work was being done without TODO entries and without full-loop testing. Rule added to AGENTS.md: every change must (1) have a TODO entry, (2) ask user whether to implement now or queue, (3) if implementing, follow full-loop (plan->implement->test->verify->deliver). Prevents shipping untested code.
- [x] t185 Memory audit pulse — periodic scan of memories for self-improvement opportunities #feature #memory #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#675 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T23:42:46Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #691 merged
  - [x] t185.1 Add memory-audit command to memory-helper.sh ~45m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: New command that scans all memories and produces actionable output. Logic: (1) Find recurring patterns — same error type 3+ times across different tasks = needs a fix task. (2) Check FAILED_APPROACH memories against merged PRs — if the referenced PR/issue is resolved, mark memory as graduated. (3) Identify DECISION/CODEBASE_PATTERN memories not yet in shared docs — flag for graduation. (4) Detect duplicates and near-duplicates for pruning. Output: structured report with proposed TODOs, graduation candidates, and prune candidates.
  - [x] t185.2 Wire memory audit into supervisor pulse as periodic phase ~30m blocked-by:t185.1
    - Notes: Add Phase 9 to pulse cycle (after issue-sync Phase 8). Run memory-audit every N pulses (e.g. every 50th pulse = ~every 4 hours with 5-min cron). When recurring patterns found, auto-create TODO entries with ref to the memory IDs. When graduation candidates found, create t184-style tasks. When prune candidates found, auto-prune with log.
  - [x] t185.3 Add memory lifecycle states (active/graduated/pruned) ~30m blocked-by:t185.1
    - Notes: Add status column to learnings table: active (default), graduated (moved to docs, link to file:line), pruned (resolved, link to PR#). Graduated memories stay in DB as audit trail but don't appear in recall. This enables the full lifecycle: capture -> validate -> graduate -> prune.
  - Notes: Closes the self-improvement loop. Currently memories accumulate but nothing reviews them for action. This session manually audited 881 memories down to 26, created 6 tasks (t179-t184), and pruned 855 entries. That process should be automated. The pulse checks for: recurring errors needing fix tasks, resolved issues to prune, validated learnings to graduate into shared docs.

  - [x] t184.1 Add supervisor architecture decisions to architecture.md ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: 7 DECISION memories about supervisor role (pure control plane, never does worker tasks, self-improving dispatch loop), agent tiers (draft/custom/shared), evaluation priority order, concurrency limits. These are framework-defining decisions that new users and contributors need.
  - [x] t184.2 Add macOS bash 3.2 constraints and model routing to code-standards.md ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: No associative arrays, grep-based key=value parsing, heuristic eval gated on non-zero exit. Model routing: Opus for race conditions/bugs, Sonnet for features, Haiku misses edge cases on complex shell. Also: worktree rebase before push pattern.
  - [x] t184.3 Add cherry-pick recovery and curl verification limits to relevant subagents ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Cherry-pick recovery (gh pr view --json commits -> git fetch -> cherry-pick) goes in conflict-resolution.md. Curl/HTTP status code limitation (200 on React crash) goes in browser-automation.md verification section.
  - [x] t184.4 Add memory graduation workflow to build-agent.md ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Document the pattern: memories are a staging area for learnings. Once validated (fix merged, pattern confirmed), graduate into shared docs. Add /graduate-memories command or integrate into session-review. Prevents knowledge staying local.
  - Notes: Memory audit found 26 useful learnings that only exist locally. 7 architecture decisions, 5 codebase patterns, 3 model routing insights, and recovery techniques that would help all aidevops users. These need to move from SQLite memory into shipped docs.
- [x] t180 Post-merge verification via todo/VERIFY.md — dispatch verification workers after PR merge to confirm deliverables work #feature #supervisor #quality ~3h (ai:2h test:1h) ref:GH#670 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T22:38:20Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #679 merged
  - [x] t180.1 Add verify states to supervisor state machine (merged -> verifying -> verified/verify_failed) ~1h blocked-by:none
    - Notes: New states between merged and deployed. On merge, supervisor auto-appends entry to todo/VERIFY.md with task ID, PR number, changed files, and auto-generated check commands. Dispatch a verification worker that runs the checks. If verify fails, task goes to verify_failed and reopens the TODO.md task with a bugfix note.
  - [x] t180.2 Create VERIFY.md auto-population in supervisor merge phase ~30m blocked-by:t180.1
    - Notes: After PR merge, supervisor extracts: changed files from PR, generates check commands (shellcheck for .sh, file-exists for .md, rg for index references), appends to todo/VERIFY.md. Format is TOON-style with check: directives per entry.
  - [x] t180.3 Create verification worker prompt and dispatch logic ~30m blocked-by:t180.1
    - Notes: Lightweight worker reads todo/VERIFY.md, runs each check: directive, marks [x] (pass) or [!] (fail) with evidence. On fail, reopens original task in TODO.md and creates follow-up bugfix task. On pass, supervisor transitions to deployed and marks TODO.md [x].
  - [x] t180.4 Wire verify phase into pulse cycle ~30m blocked-by:t180.1
    - Notes: After merge phase, auto-dispatch verify worker for entries in VERIFY.md. Only transition to deployed after verify passes. Add --skip-verify flag for trusted/trivial tasks. Batch verify multiple tasks in single worker dispatch for efficiency.
  - Notes: Root cause: 12 GitHub issues were open for tasks marked [x] that were never verified. Memory audit revealed pattern of tasks marked complete without checking deliverables actually work. Design: todo/VERIFY.md acts as a verification queue with machine-parseable check directives. Workers verify, supervisor acts on results.

  - [x] t181.1 Add content-hash dedup on memory store ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Before inserting, check if a memory with identical or near-identical content already exists (fuzzy match using word overlap, similar to consolidate). Skip insert if >90% match. Currently 23 copies of "Failed: Task blocked" exist.
  - [x] t181.2 Cap supervisor retry/pulse log memories ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Auto-distill and supervisor retry logging create duplicate entries every pulse cycle. Either: (a) only store first occurrence of each retry pattern per task, or (b) update existing memory instead of creating new one, or (c) use a separate retry_log table instead of learnings.
  - [x] t181.3 Auto-prune memories for issues that have been fixed ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: When a PR merges that fixes an issue referenced in a memory, mark those memories as resolved/stale. Could tag with PR# and auto-archive on merge. Currently 350 ERROR_FIX memories, many for issues fixed weeks ago.
  - Notes: 881 memories, 654 auto-captured, massive duplication. Top duplicate: "Failed: Task blocked" x23. Auto-distill creates identical entries across pulse cycles. Memory is becoming noise rather than signal.

  - Notes: "Monitor & Auto-Fix Code Quality" GHA workflow re-introduced a ShellCheck bug in clawdhub-helper.sh by adding invalid "|| exit" after "then" clauses. The bot's fix patterns need validation against ShellCheck/linters before committing. Options: (a) disable auto-fix for shell scripts, (b) add ShellCheck validation step after auto-fix, (c) require PR instead of direct commit for auto-fixes.
- [x] t183 Fix supervisor no_log_file dispatch failures — improve error capture when worker fails to start #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#673 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T23:07:23Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #685 merged
  - Notes: Many tasks fail with no_log_file — dispatch runs but produces no log. Root cause likely: dispatch command fails silently before worker starts (e.g. opencode binary not found, worktree creation fails, prompt too long). Need: (a) capture stderr from dispatch command, (b) write a minimal log entry even on dispatch failure, (c) distinguish "worker never started" from "worker started but log missing".

  - [x] t179.1 Add cmd_close fallback: search by task ID in issue title when ref:GH# doesn't match ~30m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: cmd_close() currently only looks up issues by ref:GH#NNN from TODO.md. When ref:GH# is stale/wrong (e.g. issue recreated with new number), the close silently skips. Add fallback: gh issue list --search "tNNN in:title" --state open. Also fix ref:GH# in TODO.md when mismatch detected.
  - [x] t179.2 Add reconcile command to fix mismatched ref:GH# values in TODO.md ~30m blocked-by:t179.1
    - Notes: Scan all tasks with ref:GH#, verify the issue number matches an issue with the task ID in its title. Fix mismatches. Run as part of status command output.
  - [x] t179.3 Wire issue-sync close into supervisor pulse cycle as periodic reconciliation ~30m blocked-by:t179.1
    - Notes: Add Phase 8 to pulse cycle: run issue-sync-helper.sh close after TODO reconciliation (Phase 7). Only run when no workers active (same guard as reconcile-todo). Prevents stale issues accumulating between manual syncs.
  - [x] t179.4 Add issue-sync close to postflight/session-review checklist ~15m blocked-by:t179.1
    - Notes: After PR merge and TODO update, remind to check issue sync. Or auto-run close as part of postflight.
  - Notes: Root cause discovered 2026-02-08: 12 GitHub issues were open for completed tasks because ref:GH# values in TODO.md didn't match actual issue numbers (issues recreated with new numbers by push command). The GHA workflow runs close on push but uses ref:GH# for lookup, missing the mismatched issues. Also fixed: task ID grep truncation bug (t131 matching t131.vision) in PR #668.

    - Notes: Parse opencode.json and provider configs to list available models. Categorise as free vs paid. For /compare-models, prompt user to select 2+ models from any provider. For /compare-models-free, auto-select all free-tier models. Use model-routing.md tiers as reference. Need to handle provider auth (some models need API keys, free models may not).

    - Notes: For each model, dispatch the user's test task as a subagent call (Task tool with model-specific subagent). Run in-session via parallel Task tool calls where possible. For long-running comparisons (large tasks, many models), support fallback to headless dispatch via supervisor with results collected via mailbox. Each model gets identical prompt + context. Capture: response text, token count, latency, any errors. The main session model orchestrates but does NOT participate in the comparison itself.

    - Notes: Main session model evaluates all responses side-by-side. Criteria: correctness, completeness, code quality (if code task), clarity, adherence to instructions. Output structured comparison table (model, score, strengths, weaknesses, latency, tokens). Support both text tasks and code tasks. Store results in memory for cross-session model selection insights.

    - Notes: Slash commands created in PR #660 (compare-models.md, compare-models-free.md, score-responses.md). Scoring framework wired in PR #773 (compare-models-helper.sh score/results commands) and response-scoring-helper.sh. All three commands reference correct helpers and are functional.
  - Notes: Single-session workflow: user invokes command, selects models (or auto-selects free), provides task, subagents execute in parallel, main model compares results. For long-running tasks (>2min per model), fall back to headless dispatch with supervisor collecting results. Builds on t132 (model routing) infrastructure. Key constraint: the evaluating model should not be one of the compared models to avoid bias. Free models vary by provider - OpenRouter, Google (Gemini Flash), Anthropic (Haiku via free tier), Groq, etc.

Builds on t163 (completion guards) and t128 (supervisor). Consider rate limits and API costs. Could also integrate other review bots (Codacy, SonarCloud) as additional signal sources. **t167 research confirms Gemini CLI as viable additional signal source** -- add subtask for gemini-cli integration alongside CodeRabbit. Gemini CLI is free (1000 req/day), local, and avoids PR-only limitation of GitHub bot.

  - Notes: **Research complete (2026-02-08).** Gemini Code Assist GitHub bot (`gemini-code-assist[bot]`) only reviews PR diffs -- confirmed via official docs (developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code, updated 2026-02-02). No full codebase review API or trigger exists. Commands limited to `/gemini review`, `/gemini summary`, `@gemini-code-assist` -- all PR-scoped. Consumer quota: 33 PR reviews/day; Enterprise: 100+/day. **Three approaches evaluated:**
  - **Option 1: Synthetic full-diff PR** -- Create branch from empty tree (`git commit-tree $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)`), PR against main. Forces Gemini to review entire codebase as a "diff". VIABLE but hacky: creates noise in PR history, may hit review size limits, 33/day consumer quota means 1 daily review is feasible. Recommended as interim approach for t166 integration.
  - **Option 2: Gemini CLI (gemini-cli)** -- Open-source CLI agent with ReAct loop, file read/write, MCP support. Free tier: 1000 requests/day, 60/min. Can be prompted to review codebase locally without GitHub bot. MOST VIABLE for daily pulse: run `gemini review the codebase for quality issues` in repo dir, parse structured output. No PR needed. Integrates via supervisor dispatch like any other CLI tool.
  - **Option 3: Gemini API directly** -- Use Gemini 3 Pro/Flash via API with 1M token context window. Feed repo contents, get structured review. VIABLE but requires API key management and custom integration code. Higher cost than CLI approach.
  - **Recommendation:** Option 2 (Gemini CLI) is the best path for t166 integration. It's free, local, scriptable, and avoids the PR-only limitation of the GitHub bot. Add as t166 subtask: `gemini-cli-helper.sh review` command that runs Gemini CLI codebase review, parses output into same structured format as CodeRabbit findings. Option 1 (synthetic PR) is a viable fallback if CLI output quality is insufficient. Option 3 is overkill for this use case.
  - **Quality assessment:** Gemini's review on PR #622 caught a real regex issue (high severity) but also produced false positives. Same bot-review verification rules from t166.2 apply.

- [x] t158 Fix supervisor dispatch so dynamically-created tasks work with /full-loop #bugfix #supervisor #orchestration ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#573 logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 verified:2026-02-08 PR #574 merged
  - Notes: Problem: supervisor adds tasks to its DB but not to TODO.md, so workers running /full-loop cannot find the task description. Fix: 1) build_dispatch_cmd now passes task description inline in the prompt (` -- description`), 2) full-loop.md Step 0 has 3-tier resolution: inline desc > TODO.md > supervisor DB, 3) full-loop-helper.sh PR creation queries supervisor DB as fallback. Also adds headless worker rules (no user prompts, no TODO.md edits, graceful auth failure handling) and PR creation hardening (gh auth check, rebase before push, proper title/body).
- [x] t160 fix: supervisor TODO.md push fails under concurrent workers, add reconcile-todo command #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#579 logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 verified:2026-02-08 PR #589 merged
  - Notes: Root cause: update_todo_on_complete() commits TODO.md locally but git push fails when multiple concurrent workers push to main simultaneously (non-fast-forward). The function logs a warning but treats it as non-blocking, so tasks transition to deployed even though TODO.md was never pushed. Fix: add commit_and_push_todo() helper with pull-rebase retry logic (3 attempts with backoff). Add reconcile-todo command for bulk reconciliation. Wire reconcile into pulse cycle Phase 7 (runs when no workers active). Affected 12 tasks from batch-20260208.
- [x] t162 fix: supervisor DB safety - add backup-before-migrate and explicit column migrations #bugfix #supervisor ~30m (ai:25m test:5m) ref:GH#590 logged:2026-02-08 started:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08
  - Notes: Root cause: t128.8 migration uses INSERT INTO tasks SELECT * FROM tasks_old which fails on column count mismatch if migrations run out of order. No backup before destructive table rename/recreate migrations. Fix: 1) Add backup_db() helper with SQLite .backup, timestamped copies, auto-prune to 5. 2) Add backup before t128.8 and t148 destructive migrations. 3) Fix t128.8 SELECT * to use explicit column list. 4) Add backup/restore commands for manual recovery.

  - [x] t163.1 Add task completion rules to AGENTS.md Planning & Tasks section ~15m blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Rule: NEVER mark [x] unless YOU wrote code/content in THIS session. Workers leave tasks for reviewer. Verify deliverable exists and is substantive before marking.
  - [x] t163.2 Add guard to issue-sync-helper.sh cmd_close() - require merged PR or verified: field ~1h blocked-by:none
    - Notes: cmd_close currently blindly closes issues when TODO.md has [x]. Add check: task must have either a merged PR ref or verified:YYYY-MM-DD field. Dry-run by default, --force for real close.
  - [x] t163.3 Add pre-commit validation for TODO.md [x] transitions ~1h blocked-by:none
    - Notes: Git hook or CI check: when task goes [ ] -> [x], verify current branch has commits touching related files. Warn if no deliverable found.
  - [x] t163.4 Add supervisor verify phase after worker PR merge ~1.5h blocked-by:none
    - Notes: After merge, supervisor checks: file exists, not empty, ShellCheck pass for .sh, word count > threshold for .md. Only after verify -> [x] + issue close.

  - Notes: `cmd_update()` in aidevops.sh calls `bash setup.sh` without `--non-interactive`, so interactive prompts silently skip in non-TTY contexts and agents never deploy. Re-dispatched after stdout leak fix (PR #643).

    - Notes: check_system_load() at line 197, calculate_adaptive_concurrency() at line 310, resource stats in pulse Phase 5 summary, max_load_factor column in batches table with migration.
    - Notes: Discovered during batch-20260207 run: 3 concurrent workers spawned 51 opencode + 149 node processes, load avg hit 116 on 10-core machine. Supervisor has model health checks and orphan cleanup but no system resource awareness. Each opencode worker spawns ~15-20 sub-processes (MCP servers, LSPs). Need: load average monitoring, process count per worker, adaptive concurrency (pause dispatch when overloaded, resume when load drops).
  - Notes: From Claude Opus 4.6 codebase review (2026-02-07). Review corrected: 100/170 scripts already have set -e (not 2 as initially reported). 29/170 use shared-constants.sh. 95 scripts have blanket 20+ rule ShellCheck disable. 12 fix scripts have 0 references and only exist from the .agent->.agents rename commit. All subtasks designed for /runners dispatch. IMPORTANT: Review recommendation #10 (organize scripts by domain subdirectories) was REJECTED - scripts are cross-domain and flat namespace with naming convention is the intentional design. Recommendation #13 (remove dead fix scripts) changed to ARCHIVE non-destructively. Every subtask requires reading existing code to understand intent before changes.

    - Notes: OpenCode supports per-agent model selection natively -- the Task tool doesn't accept a model param, but each subagent definition can specify its own model. Create subagents like gemini-reviewer (google/gemini-3-pro-preview), gemini-analyst (google/gemini-3-flash-preview), gpt-reviewer (openai/gpt-4.1), etc. Map existing model-routing.md tiers (haiku/flash/sonnet/pro/opus) to concrete agent definitions. Primary agent selects model by choosing which subagent to invoke.

    - Notes: OpenCode provider/model names change (new models released, old ones deprecated, naming conventions shift). Create model-registry-helper.sh that: 1) Scrapes available models from OpenCode config / Models.dev / provider APIs, 2) Compares against our configured models in opencode.json and model-routing.md, 3) Flags deprecated/renamed/unavailable models, 4) Suggests new models worth adding. Run periodically (cron or manual) and on `aidevops update`. Store registry in SQLite alongside memory/mail DBs.

    - Notes: PR #781 merged. fallback-chain-helper.sh and fallback-chain-config.json.txt implement per-agent and global fallback chains with gateway provider support (OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway). Triggers: API error, timeout, rate limit, empty response.

Priority chain: task explicit model > subagent YAML frontmatter > fallback-chain-helper.sh > model-availability-helper.sh > static defaults. Tier names (haiku/sonnet/opus/flash/pro/grok) mapped to concrete provider/model strings.

    - Notes: PR #788 merged. Added get_next_tier(), check_output_quality(), run_quality_gate() to supervisor-helper.sh. Heuristic quality checks (log size, error patterns, file changes, syntax errors, token-to-substance ratio). Escalation chain: haiku->sonnet->opus, flash->pro. Schema: escalation_depth/max_escalation on tasks, skip_quality_gate on batches. --skip-quality-gate flag on batch command.

    - Notes: PR #789 merged. Added resolve_model_tier() and detect_ai_backends() to shared-constants.sh. Runner and cron helpers now accept tier names (haiku/sonnet/opus/flash/pro/grok) in --model flag. New --provider flag for provider override. cron-dispatch.sh now sources shared-constants.sh.
  - [x] t132.8 Cross-model review workflow (second-opinion pattern) ~2h blocked-by:t132.7 ref:GH#740 completed:2026-02-09 pr:#791
    - Notes: PR #791 merged. Added cross-review command to compare-models-helper.sh. Dispatches same prompt to N models in parallel via runner-helper.sh, collects results, generates word count comparison and unified diff. Default models: sonnet,opus. Configurable --models, --timeout, --workdir, --output.
  - Notes: OpenCode already supports per-agent model selection (each agent definition can have its own `model:` field across 75+ providers). The Task tool selects a model by invoking a subagent that has that model configured -- not via a model parameter on the call itself. Currently model-routing.md exists as design doc and all 195 subagents have model: frontmatter, but no corresponding agent definitions in opencode.json enforce it. Runner --model only works with single hardcoded provider. No fallback on failure, no availability checking, no quality-based escalation. Provider/model names are a moving target and need periodic reconciliation. This blocks use cases like "get a Gemini review of the codebase from within a Claude session."

  - Notes: Previously closed 2026-02-07 as "no public repo found". Repo is now public (9.9k stars, AGPL-3.0, actively maintained). Shannon is a fully autonomous AI pentester: white-box source-aware, Docker-based, covers Injection/XSS/SSRF/Broken Auth, 96.15% XBOW benchmark success rate, uses Claude as reasoning engine, produces pentester-grade reports with reproducible PoCs. Runs ~1-1.5h per scan, ~$50/run on Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Integration plan: create .agents/tools/security/shannon.md subagent, add shannon-helper.sh wrapper script, document setup (Docker + Anthropic API key), wire into preflight/postflight or standalone /pentest command.

  - Notes: Dexter (11.4k stars, TypeScript, actively maintained Feb 2026). Autonomous agent for deep financial research with task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data (Financial Datasets API + Exa). Uses Bun runtime + OpenAI. Evaluation: 1) Too domain-specific for core aidevops (financial data APIs only), 2) Task planning/self-validation patterns already implemented in supervisor and ralph-loop, 3) Could be imported as optional skill for finance-focused users. Recommendation: No integration needed. Users can install directly if needed.

  - Notes: Weave (14 stars, Rust, MIT, early development). Intercepts system calls to make execution deterministic (time, RNG, thread scheduling). Only supports Darwin/arm64 and Linux/x86. Evaluation: 1) Interesting concept but too early-stage (limited platform support, small community), 2) aidevops agents are inherently non-deterministic (LLM responses vary) so deterministic syscalls alone don't help, 3) Better suited for traditional software testing than AI agent debugging. Recommendation: Monitor for maturity, no integration now.

  - Notes: progressive-memory (0 stars, Shell, MIT): Filesystem-based progressive disclosure for agent memory. Uses 3-level files (one-liner / summary / full detail) loaded via head/sed/cat. clawdbot (0 stars): Multi-platform AI assistant, minimal content. Evaluation: 1) Progressive disclosure pattern is sound -- aidevops already uses this for subagents (AI-CONTEXT-START blocks, YAML frontmatter), 2) aidevops memory-helper.sh with SQLite FTS5 is more capable (search, consolidation, auto-capture, cross-session), 3) The filesystem approach is simpler but doesn't scale for search/dedup. Recommendation: No adoption needed. aidevops already implements the progressive disclosure pattern more robustly.

- [x] t060 Research jj (Jujutsu) VCS for aidevops advantages #research #git #tools ~15m (ai:10m read:5m) ref:GH#514 logged:2026-01-13 ref:https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj verified:2026-02-08
  - Notes: Git-compatible VCS (25.6k stars, v0.38.0, Apache-2.0, 300+ contributors, backed by Google). Written in Rust, uses gitoxide for Git backend. Key features: working-copy-as-commit (no staging area), operation log with full undo, conflicts as first-class objects, automatic rebase of descendants, anonymous branches (bookmarks), revset query language, safe concurrent replication.
  - Evaluation for aidevops:
    - RECOMMENDED: Colocated mode (`jj git init --colocate`) as bridge strategy. Maintains full git compatibility (all 39 scripts + 67 docs still work), allows gradual adoption, preserves GitHub/CI integration. jj and git commands work interchangeably in same repo.
    - HIGH VALUE: Operation log + undo eliminates the destructive command risk that spawned t009 (PreToolUse hooks). `jj undo` reverses any operation including the equivalent of `git reset --hard`. Would reduce need for pre-edit-check.sh defensive machinery (206 lines).
    - HIGH VALUE: jj workspaces (`jj workspace add`) are lighter than git worktrees. Could simplify the 3-tier fallback chain (wt -> worktree-helper.sh -> raw git worktree) in supervisor-helper.sh parallel dispatch.
    - MEDIUM VALUE: No staging area simplifies commit workflow. Working copy is always a commit, eliminating "dirty working copy" errors and `git stash` usage (7 files). Automatic rebase of descendants eliminates manual `git rebase main` after fetching (9 files).
    - MEDIUM VALUE: First-class conflicts enable committing conflicted state, resolving later. Valuable for supervisor parallel task dispatch where agents touch overlapping files. Conflict resolution propagates through descendants automatically.
    - MEDIUM VALUE: Change IDs persist through squash-merge/rebase/amend, solving the squash-merge detection problem in worktree-helper.sh `cmd_clean()` (currently uses fragile heuristics).
    - CONCERN: No git hooks support yet (issue #405). Pre-commit hooks are used by aidevops for quality gates. Workaround: run linters via jj's `run` command (design doc exists) or keep colocated mode where git hooks still fire.
    - CONCERN: No git submodules support yet. Not a blocker for aidevops (no submodules used).
    - CONCERN: No .gitattributes support (issue #53). Minor impact.
    - CONCERN: Still experimental (pre-1.0). Core devs use it daily, but storage format may change before 1.0. Colocated mode mitigates this -- can always fall back to pure git.
    - CONCERN: Learning curve for team. jj concepts (changes vs commits, bookmarks vs branches, revsets) differ from git mental model. Mitigated by colocated mode allowing gradual adoption.
  - Recommendation: Add jj as OPTIONAL tool in setup.sh alongside Worktrunk. Create a `tools/git/jj.md` subagent documenting jj equivalents for common aidevops git operations. Do NOT replace git -- use colocated mode as an enhancement layer. Revisit after jj 1.0 for deeper integration.
  - Follow-up tasks: t060.1 Add jj installation to setup.sh (optional), t060.2 Create tools/git/jj.md subagent, t060.3 Test jj colocated mode with supervisor parallel dispatch.

  - Notes: Vercel's Agent Skills collection (19.4k stars, MIT, 117 commits, 17 contributors). Now 5 skills: react-best-practices (57 rules, 8 categories), web-design-guidelines (100+ rules), react-native-guidelines (16 rules), composition-patterns, vercel-deploy-claimable. Follows agentskills.io format (SKILL.md structure). agentskills.io is now an open standard adopted by 27+ tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.).
  - Decision: 1) vercel-deploy-claimable: SKIP - designed for claude.ai/Desktop conversations, not CLI agents. aidevops already has full Vercel CLI integration (tools/deployment/vercel.md + vercel-cli-helper.sh) which is more capable. 2) react-best-practices: CANDIDATE for import via `/add-skill vercel-labs/agent-skills` - 57 rules would complement existing code-standards. Create follow-up task. 3) Agent Skills format: ALREADY ADOPTED - aidevops already generates SKILL.md stubs via generate-skills.sh and imports external skills via add-skill-helper.sh. Full compatibility exists. 4) Contribute back: DEFERRED - aidevops skills use progressive disclosure pattern with subagent folders, which is compatible but more complex than typical SKILL.md. Consider contributing simpler skills (mermaid-diagrams, seo-audit) when the ecosystem matures.

  - Notes: DECLINED - Neural-Chromium has only 4 stars, no releases, and is Windows-only. Not viable for macOS/Linux users. Better alternatives: browser-use (77.8k stars, cross-platform), Stagehand (20.8k stars, already documented), Skyvern (20.3k stars). The existing neural-chromium.md subagent should be removed. Features: 1.3s interaction latency (4.7x faster than Playwright), semantic DOM understanding via accessibility tree, VLM-powered vision (Llama 3.2 via Ollama), stealth capabilities (no navigator.webdriver), deep iframe access. Uses shared memory + gRPC for direct browser state access. Tools: click(element_id), type(element_id, text), observe() for DOM snapshots. Early stage but promising for agent automation. Evaluate for: CAPTCHA solving, dynamic SPA interaction, form filling. Add to tools/browser/ as experimental option.

  - Notes: Review complete. See todo/research/pi-agent-review.md. Key findings: Pi's minimal 4-tool core validates aidevops's on-demand MCP loading. Session trees (branching/rewinding) are the most interesting feature aidevops lacks but can't implement without agent-level support. Extension hot-reload is powerful but different architecture from aidevops's markdown subagents.

  - Notes: Tirith (1,300 stars, Rust, AGPL-3.0) - also see t104 plan: Tirith's `tirith run` command provides verified download-then-execute as the implementation vehicle for curl|sh hardening. - terminal security tool that catches attacks browsers block but terminals don't. **30 rules across 7 categories:** 1) Homograph attacks (Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes, punycode, mixed-script). 2) Terminal injection (ANSI escapes, bidi overrides, zero-width chars). 3) Pipe-to-shell (`curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `eval $(wget ...)`). 4) Dotfile attacks (downloads targeting ~/.bashrc, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). 5) Insecure transport (HTTP piped to shell, `curl -k`). 6) Ecosystem threats (git clone typosquats, untrusted Docker registries, pip/npm URL installs). 7) Credential exposure (userinfo tricks, shortened URLs). **Integration options:** 1) Add to aidevops setup/onboarding as recommended install. 2) Create tirith.md subagent at tools/security/. 3) Document shell hook setup (`eval "$(tirith init)"`). 4) Consider MCP wrapper for `tirith check` command validation. **Key features:** Sub-millisecond overhead, local-only (no network calls), YAML policy config, bypass with `TIRITH=0` prefix. Install: `brew install sheeki03/tap/tirith` or `npm install -g tirith` or `cargo install tirith`.

  - [x] t134.3 Update aidevops init with optional SOPS setup ~45m ref:GH#747 pr:751 verified:2026-02-09
    - Notes: Add `aidevops init sops` feature flag. Creates .sops.yaml with age key, adds patterns for common secret files (*.secret.yaml, configs/*.enc.json). Add to features list. Non-breaking -- only activates when explicitly requested.
  - [x] t134.4 Document full encryption stack in credentials docs ~30m ref:GH#748 pr:751 verified:2026-02-09
    - Notes: Update gopass.md and api-key-setup.md with encryption stack overview: gopass (secret values), SOPS (config files in repos), gocryptfs (local folders). Decision record: chose SOPS over git-crypt (value-level encryption, CNCF backing, key rotation) and gocryptfs over VeraCrypt (no disk images to manage, CLI-native, overlay filesystem).
- [x] t191 Fix secretlint-helper.sh install and scan in git worktrees #bugfix #tools #secretlint ~1h (ai:40m test:15m read:5m) ref:GH#711 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T02:53:00Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09
  - Notes: secretlint-helper.sh install puts packages in main repo node_modules/, but scan runs in CWD. In worktrees, node_modules/ doesn't exist so check_rules_installed() always fails. Fix: resolve main worktree path via `git worktree list --porcelain | head -1`, use `npm list --prefix <main_path>` as fallback, and make install worktree-aware (install to main repo or symlink).
- [x] t192 Supervisor evaluates successful workers as clean_exit_no_signal — misses PR URL from logs #bugfix #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#719 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T03:38:15Z logged:2026-02-09 pr:750 verified:2026-02-09
  - Notes: Workers that create PRs and exit cleanly are evaluated as clean_exit_no_signal because the evaluation heuristic doesn't detect PR URLs from the worker's JSON log output. This causes unnecessary retries (observed for t191 and t134 in backlog-06). Fix: in evaluate_worker(), parse the worker log for gh pr create output or PR URLs before falling back to clean_exit_no_signal. The pr_url field should be populated from the log even when the worker doesn't explicitly signal completion.
- [x] t193 setup.sh fails in non-interactive supervisor deploy step #bugfix #setup ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#720 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T03:40:31Z logged:2026-02-09 pr:749 verified:2026-02-09
  - Notes: When supervisor runs setup.sh as a deploy step (pr-lifecycle deploying phase), it fails because setup.sh hits an interactive prompt for shell integration. The script needs a --non-interactive or --ci flag that skips interactive prompts and only copies agent files. Observed during t191 deploy — setup.sh output truncated at "Shell integration not detected" with non-zero exit.

  - Notes: Added dedicated `bash -n` handler before generic `bash` handler. Tested with v999 entry, proof log shows "syntax OK".

- [x] t205 YouTube competitor research and content automation agent #feature #youtube #content ~6h actual:4h logged:2026-02-09 started:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 pr:811
  - Notes: Post-merge verification (2026-02-09): ShellCheck clean (SC1091 info only), markdownlint clean after PR #828 fixed 12 MD022 violations, all cross-references resolve, live API tests pass (auth-test, channel @mkbhd, quota tracking). 9/10000 API units used.
  - [x] t205.1 youtube-helper.sh — YouTube Data API v3 wrapper with SA JWT auth, token caching, quota tracking, 8 commands ~2h

  - [x] t205.8 Register in subagent-index.toon and AGENTS.md progressive disclosure table ~15m
  - Notes: GCP SA auth (seo-utils@evergreen-je), all youtube-helper.sh commands tested live (channel, videos, video, competitors, quota). ShellCheck zero violations. Google OAuth2 JWT grant type discovery documented. PR #811 merged via squash.
- [x] t190 Fix Codacy MD022 violations in memory graduation output #bugfix #quality ~30m actual:15m assignee:alexey ref:GH#703 logged:2026-02-09 started:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #703 merged
  - Notes: memory-graduate-helper.sh generates markdown without blank lines before ### category headings (MD022). Root cause: bash `$(cat file)` strips trailing newlines. Fixed generator with first_category flag and corrected existing output.
- [x] t069 Fix toon-helper.sh validate command #bugfix ~15m actual:10m logged:2026-01-24 completed:2026-01-25
  - Notes: Fixed - validate command now correctly receives input_file via $arg2 from case statement. Verified code at lines 437-442 properly passes arguments.
- [x] t010 Evaluate Merging build-agent and build-mcp into aidevops #plan ~4h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: Decision: Keep as subagents in tools/ (not merge into aidevops.md). Implemented in v2.41.0 - generate-opencode-agents.sh cleans up old files, architecture.md documents the pattern.
- [x] t018 Enhance Plan+ and Build+ with OpenCode's Latest Features #plan ~3h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: All 4 phases complete. 1) Disabled built-in build/plan agents. 2) Set Plan+ as default_agent. 3) Added granular bash permissions for file discovery (git ls-files, fd, rg --files). 4) Updated generate-opencode-agents.sh. PR #123 merged.

  - Notes: SonarCloud quality gate was already OK. Fixed OpenCode Agent workflow failing on `pull_request_review_comment` events due to `context.payload.issue` being undefined. Now uses `context.payload.pull_request` as fallback and appropriate API methods for PR review comments. PR #121 merged.
