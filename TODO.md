  - Notes: Created mcp-index-helper.sh with SQLite FTS5 for tool discovery. Commands: sync, search, list, status, rebuild, get-mcp. Created tools/context/mcp-discovery.md subagent. Enables lazy-load MCP pattern.
- [x] t057 Memory consolidation and pruning #memory #optimization ~2h (ai:1h test:45m read:15m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052 started:2026-01-21T06:00Z completed:2026-01-21 actual:15m
  - Notes: Added consolidate command to memory-helper.sh. Finds similar memories using word overlap, merges tags, keeps older entry. Supports --dry-run and --threshold options.
- [ ] t058 Memory Auto-Capture #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#memory-auto-capture] ~1d (ai:6h test:4h read:2h) logged:2026-01-11
  - Notes: Automatic memory capture inspired by claude-mem but tool-agnostic. Agent instructions trigger capture after significant operations. Works with OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf. PRD: todo/tasks/prd-memory-auto-capture.md
- [ ] t060 Research jj (Jujutsu) VCS for aidevops advantages #research #git #tools ~2h (ai:1h read:1h) logged:2026-01-13 ref:https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj
  - Notes: Git-compatible VCS (24.7k stars) with unique features: working-copy-as-commit (no staging area), operation log with undo, conflicts as first-class objects, automatic rebase of descendants, anonymous branches. Could simplify worktree workflows, enable safer experimentation, and provide better conflict handling. Evaluate: 1) Integration with existing git workflows 2) Colocated mode compatibility 3) Benefits for AI-assisted development 4) Learning curve vs productivity gains.
- [ ] t061 Create debug-opengraph and debug-favicon subagents #tools #seo #browser ~3h (ai:2h test:30m read:30m) logged:2026-01-14 ref:https://opengraphdebug.com/
  - Notes: Inspired by opengraphdebug.com. Two subagents: 1) debug-opengraph.md - validate Open Graph meta tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, twitter:card), preview social sharing appearance, check image dimensions/accessibility. 2) debug-favicon.md - validate favicon setup across platforms (favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon, manifest icons), check sizes/formats, verify PWA manifest. Could use browser automation (Stagehand/Playwright) or direct HTML parsing. Add to tools/seo/ or tools/browser/.
- [ ] t062 Research vercel-labs/agent-skills for inclusion in aidevops #research #tools #deployment ~2h (ai:1h read:1h) logged:2026-01-14 ref:https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills

- [ ] t064 Add seo-regex subagent with Search Console regex workflow #seo #tools ~30m (ai:20m read:10m) logged:2026-01-15
- [ ] t066 /add-skill System for External Skill Import #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#add-skill-system-for-external-skill-import] ~2d (ai:1d test:0.5d read:0.5d) logged:2026-01-21
  - Notes: Import external AI agent skills (SKILL.md, AGENTS.md) into aidevops with upstream tracking, conflict detection, merge support, and multi-assistant output generation. Research complete - see PLANS.md for full PRD. Branch: feature/add-skill-command
  - Notes: Load up Search Console → Performance → Filter Query → Query Regex → paste `^(?:\S+\s+){6,}\S+$`. You're already ranking for all these and people are finding you on these topics. Copy the first query (or whatever you want to write about) → Google → take the first 3 SERP results → using detailed copy all the headings. Plug it into your favorite LLM and ask it to write for you on this topic. Edit it so it feels natural. Works well because you're already ranking for these terms and people are finding you in LLMs through these channels.

- [x] t010 Evaluate Merging build-agent and build-mcp into aidevops #plan ~4h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: Decision: Keep as subagents in tools/ (not merge into aidevops.md). Implemented in v2.41.0 - generate-opencode-agents.sh cleans up old files, architecture.md documents the pattern.
- [x] t018 Enhance Plan+ and Build+ with OpenCode's Latest Features #plan ~3h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: All 4 phases complete. 1) Disabled built-in build/plan agents. 2) Set Plan+ as default_agent. 3) Added granular bash permissions for file discovery (git ls-files, fd, rg --files). 4) Updated generate-opencode-agents.sh. PR #123 merged.
- [x] t065 Fix postflight warnings: SonarCloud critical issues + OpenCode Agent workflow #bugfix #quality ~2h actual:30m logged:2026-01-17 started:2026-01-18T18:00Z completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: SonarCloud quality gate was already OK. Fixed OpenCode Agent workflow failing on `pull_request_review_comment` events due to `context.payload.issue` being undefined. Now uses `context.payload.pull_request` as fallback and appropriate API methods for PR review comments. PR #121 merged.
