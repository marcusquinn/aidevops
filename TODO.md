## Format

**Human-readable:**

```markdown
- [ ] tXXX Task description @owner #tag ~4h (ai:2h test:1h read:30m) logged:2025-01-15
  - [ ] tXXX.1 Subtask ~2h blocked-by:tYYY
    - [ ] tXXX.1.1 Sub-subtask ~1h
  - [ ] tXXX.2 Another subtask ~1h blocks:tZZZ
- [x] tYYY Completed task ~2h actual:1.5h logged:2025-01-10 completed:2025-01-15
- [-] tZZZ Declined task
```

**Task ID format:**

- `t001` - Top-level task
- `t001.1` - Subtask of t001
- `t001.1.1` - Sub-subtask of t001.1
- IDs are stable and never reused

**Dependency fields:**

- `blocked-by:t001,t002` - This task cannot start until t001 and t002 are done
- `blocks:t003,t004` - Completing this task unblocks t003 and t004
- `parent:t001` - This is a child of t001 (implicit from indentation)

**Time fields:**

- `~estimate` - Total time estimate with optional breakdown `(ai:Xh test:Xh read:Xm research:Xm)`
- `actual:` - Actual time spent (recorded at commit/release)
- `logged:` - When task was added
- `started:` - When branch was created (work began)
- `completed:` - When task was marked done

**Assignment fields:**

- `assignee:identity` - Who claimed the task (set by `supervisor-helper.sh claim`, identity = `AIDEVOPS_IDENTITY` or `user@host`)
- `@owner` - Who is responsible for the task (separate from assignee — future feature)

**Machine data:** TOON blocks in HTML comments (invisible when rendered).

- [x] t301 Rosetta audit + shell linter optimisation — detect x86 Homebrew binaries running under Rosetta on Apple Silicon Macs, offer migration to ARM-native versions. Add shellcheck/shfmt to setup.sh dependency checks. Improve linters-local.sh with batch shellcheck, shfmt pre-pass, and diff-only mode. Intel Macs skip gracefully. #feature #setup #quality #auto-dispatch ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#1173 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-12T00:11:42Z logged:2026-02-12 started:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12
- [x] t285 setup.sh should clean up stale agent files after migration — when agents are moved (e.g., youtube.md from root to content/distribution/youtube/), setup.sh copies new files but doesn't remove the old ones from ~/.aidevops/agents/. Add a migration cleanup step that removes known stale paths. For now: rm -rf ~/.aidevops/agents/youtube/ and rm -f ~/.aidevops/agents/youtube.md. Generalise with a MIGRATIONS list in setup.sh that maps old->new paths, checked on each deploy. #enhancement #setup #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) model:sonnet ref:GH#1107 logged:2026-02-11 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#1111
- [x] t286 Audit closed issues for false completions — t199.8 was closed with status:done but the worker had failed (clean_exit_no_signal) and only created a stub. The issue-sync pipeline auto-closed it. Audit all closed issues with status:done label to verify each has a merged PR with real deliverables. Check: (1) does the linked PR exist and is it merged? (2) does the PR contain substantive changes matching the task description? (3) are there any other tasks marked [x] in TODO.md that lack a valid pr: field? Output a report of any false completions found. #audit #quality #auto-dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) model:sonnet ref:GH#1108 logged:2026-02-11 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#1111
- [x] t297 Add explicit PR-required rule for all non-planning changes — AGENTS.md said "planning-only files go direct to main" but didn't explicitly state the inverse. Added: every change to scripts, agents, configs, workflows MUST go through worktree + PR + CI, no matter how small. #docs #workflow ~10m logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1160
- [x] t314 Auto-escalate model to opus on worker failure + extend worker timeout — when a worker fails (hung, crashed, max runtime), auto-escalate the task's model to the next tier via get_next_tier() before re-queuing. Currently attempt_self_heal() creates a diagnostic subtask but doesn't upgrade the model, so retries repeat with the same underpowered model. Also increase SUPERVISOR_WORKER_TIMEOUT default from 1800s (30min) to 3600s (1h) and SUPERVISOR_WORKER_MAX_RUNTIME from 7200s (2h) to 14400s (4h) — complex refactoring tasks (t311.2, t311.3) consistently hit the 30min hung timeout. Changes: (1) add escalate_model_on_failure() that calls get_next_tier() and updates the task's model in DB, (2) call it from attempt_self_heal() before creating diagnostic subtask, (3) bump default timeouts. #feature #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~45m (ai:30m test:15m) ref:GH#1214 logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1215
- [x] t313 Queue priority: fresh tasks before retries — when the dispatch queue has both fresh (never-attempted) tasks and retried/reset tasks, dispatch fresh ones first. Currently cmd_next() orders by position/created_at with no distinction. Change: add `retries` to ORDER BY so retries=0 tasks sort before retries>0. Also in Phase 2 dispatch loop, fill available slots with fresh tasks first, then use remaining capacity for retries. Prevents failed tasks from repeatedly consuming dispatch slots while completable fresh tasks wait. #feature #supervisor #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) model:sonnet assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-12T03:39:06Z ref:GH#1212 logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1213
- [x] t312 Pre-dispatch staleness check — detect outdated tasks before wasting worker tokens. Before dispatching a worker, extract key references (file paths, function names, feature names) from the task description and verify they still exist in the codebase. Also check recent git history for contradicting commits (removals, renames). Three-tier: STALE (cancel), UNCERTAIN (comment on GH issue + remove #auto-dispatch for human review), CURRENT (proceed). Test case: t008.4 added oh-my-opencode compatibility after oh-my-opencode was already removed (commit eed38e36, Feb 7) — worker built dead code that shipped in PR#1157. Includes test script with 10 tests. #feature #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) model:sonnet assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-12T03:16:42Z ref:GH#1210 logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1211

Capabilities: video interpolation (24->48/60fps via RIFE, GMFSS, IFRNet), upscaling (2x/4x via SPAN, Real-ESRGAN, AnimeJaNai), decompression (DeH264), and denoising (DRUnet/DnCNN). Supports TensorRT (NVIDIA), PyTorch (CUDA/ROCm), and NCNN (Vulkan) backends. Cross-platform (Linux/Windows/macOS). The helper should handle: installation (clone + deps), model selection, backend detection (GPU capability), batch processing, and integration with existing video production workflows (content/production/video.md post-production step). Wire into video-prompt-design.md and content.md as an optional post-processing enhancement step.

Capabilities: (1) Realistic Skin Enhancement (v1/v3 models, face/body modes, granular area control for eyes/nose/mouth/hair/background, skin refinement 0-100, portrait depth, mask support in v3), (2) Portrait Upscaler (fast/professional modes with facial feature optimization), (3) General Image Upscaler (universal image upscaling for all image types), (4) Detailed API (upscaling + detailed enhancement for professional work), (5) Kora Pro (AI image generation from text prompts with cinematic models). Async queue-based API with webhook notifications (queue -> status polling -> webhook callback). Auth via x-api-key header. Base URL: apireq.enhancor.ai. The helper should handle: API key setup via aidevops secret, queue submission, status polling with backoff, webhook URL configuration, downloading results, and batch processing.

- [x] t303 Distributed task ID allocation via claim-task-id.sh — prevent task ID collisions when multiple machines/sessions create tasks concurrently. Create issue on remote first (gh/glab) as distributed lock, then scan origin/main:TODO.md for highest tNNN, allocate t(N+1) with ref:GH#NNN. Offline fallback: allocate from local scan with t(max+100) offset, reconcile when back online. Add supervisor dedup Phase 0.5 as safety net. Wire into coderabbit-task-creator-helper.sh (currently creates tasks with no ID). Platform-agnostic: tNNN is universal, ref:GH#/GL#/GT# are platform links. #feature #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) model:sonnet ref:GH#1175 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-12T00:18:30Z logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1216
- [x] t302 Auto-resolve TODO.md merge conflicts in commit_and_push_todo() — when the supervisor and an interactive session both modify the same task line concurrently (e.g., supervisor adds `assignee:` while user adds `ref:GH#`), `git pull --rebase --autostash` fails with conflict markers in TODO.md. Since TODO.md conflicts are almost always "keep both additions to the same line", the fix is: after a failed rebase, detect conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`) in TODO.md, auto-resolve by keeping the longer line (which has both additions merged), remove markers, `git add TODO.md`, `git rebase --continue`. Add a max of 1 auto-resolve attempt before falling back to `rebase --abort`. The function `commit_and_push_todo()` at line ~10535 already has retry logic — extend it with conflict detection and resolution. #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) model:sonnet assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-12T00:19:41Z logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12

- [x] t299 Close self-improvement feedback loop — add supervisor Phase 10b to auto-create TODO tasks from CodeRabbit and quality-sweep findings. Currently Phase 10 triggers CodeRabbit reviews and findings are collected, but nobody calls `coderabbit-task-creator-helper.sh create` or `quality-sweep-helper.sh tasks` without `--dry-run`. Add a new phase after Phase 10 that: (1) calls `coderabbit-task-creator-helper.sh create` to convert CodeRabbit findings into TODO tasks with `#auto-dispatch`, (2) calls `quality-sweep-helper.sh tasks` to convert SonarCloud/Codacy findings into TODO tasks, (3) commits and pushes TODO.md if new tasks were added, (4) self-throttles with 24h cooldown like Phase 10. Currently 5 CodeRabbit findings (2 critical, 2 high) and 19 SonarCloud findings waiting. #feature #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) model:sonnet ref:GH#1169 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T23:42:07Z logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-12 pr:#1170
- [x] t296 Workers comment on GH issues when blocked — when a headless worker exits with BLOCKED or needs clarification, it should post a comment on the task's GitHub issue (via ref:GH#) explaining what information is missing and advising the user to tag with #auto-dispatch when ready for the next pass. This creates a visible feedback loop: worker tries -> comments what's needed -> user answers -> tags auto-dispatch -> supervisor re-dispatches. Requires: (1) full-loop-helper.sh captures BLOCKED reason and posts via `gh issue comment`, (2) supervisor evaluate_worker_outcome() triggers the comment on blocked exits, (3) remove auto-dispatch label from GH issue when worker is blocked so it's clear the task needs attention. #feature #supervisor #issue-sync #auto-dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) model:sonnet assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T23:16:31Z ref:GH#1159 logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-11
- [x] t298 Auto-rebase BEHIND/DIRTY PRs in supervisor pulse — when `check_pr_ci_status()` returns `ci_pending` for a BEHIND or DIRTY PR, the supervisor loops forever without attempting to fix it. Fix: in the `ci_pending` handler (~line 8804), detect BEHIND/DIRTY via `mergeStateStatus`, call existing `rebase_sibling_pr()` to attempt auto-rebase. If rebase succeeds, continue pulse (CI will re-run). If rebase fails with conflicts (return 1), transition to `blocked:merge_conflict` instead of looping. The `rebase_sibling_pr()` function already handles fetch+rebase+abort-on-conflict+force-push-with-lease safely. Test case: PR #1155 (t295) is currently CONFLICTING and stuck in ci_pending loop. Changes needed: (1) pass `mergeStateStatus` from `check_pr_ci_status()` back to caller (currently only returns a string like "ci_pending"), (2) add rebase attempt in `advance_task_lifecycle()` ci_pending handler, (3) add max rebase attempts counter (suggest 2) to avoid infinite rebase loops. #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) model:sonnet assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T23:10:07Z ref:GH#1163 logged:2026-02-12 completed:2026-02-11
- [x] t291 Fix find_closing_pr() to read pr:#NNN format from TODO.md — the function uses regex `PR #[0-9]+` which doesn't match the actual `pr:#NNN` format in TODO.md, so close comments never cite the PR even when it exists. Also: subtask IDs (t214.6) don't match parent PR titles (t214), so GitHub search fails. Fix: add Check 0 to extract pr:#NNN directly from the task line.

The page DOM changes on generation (count went from 24 to 19 after reload) so the "new images = current - baseline" logic never triggers. Generation completes successfully but the automator waits until timeout. Workaround: use `download` command after generation. Fix: detect generation completion via alternative signals — check for loading spinners disappearing, new image elements with recent timestamps, or the Generate button re-enabling after being disabled. Also consider checking the History tab which has more reliable state. #bugfix #higgsfield #automation #auto-dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#1041 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T03:12:17Z logged:2026-02-11 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#1068
- [x] t268 Higgsfield download command downloads entire history instead of latest generation — the `download` command navigates to `/image/soul` and downloads ALL images on the page (19-24 items from all previous sessions). Should only download images from the most recent generation. Fix: either (1) track the generation timestamp and only download images newer than it, (2) accept a `--count N` flag to download only the N most recent, or (3) compare against a pre-generation snapshot. Currently requires manual cleanup to separate the wanted images from old history. #enhancement #higgsfield #automation #auto-dispatch ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) ref:GH#1042 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T02:04:07Z logged:2026-02-11 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#1052

But if a previous session generated a video with a similar prompt prefix, it can match the wrong item and download stale content. Fix: compare against the full prompt text (not prefix), or use generation timestamp to ensure the matched item is newer than the generation start time.

Fix: (1) add `memory-helper.sh recall --recent --limit 5` to conversation-starter.md so recent lessons are shown at session start, (2) add a recall step to Build+ step 2 that queries memory for the task domain, (3) add recall to supervisor worker dispatch prompts so workers benefit from accumulated lessons.

  - Notes: Root cause: generate-opencode-agents.sh created stubs with empty body. OpenCode uses body as agent.prompt — empty body = default provider prompt, subagent never sees its rules. The `description` field is metadata, not an executed instruction. Fix: add one line to stub body: `**MANDATORY**: Your first action MUST be to read ~/.aidevops/agents/{rel_path} and follow ALL rules within it.` Tested: subagent now reads its .md file as first action.

Next pulse repeats the same cycle indefinitely, producing no Phase 5 summary output. Fix: (1) add explicit error handling around the transition in Step 4b with fallback to direct SQL, (2) add a loop guard in process_post_pr_lifecycle that tracks tasks already attempted this pulse and skips re-processing, (3) ensure Phase 3 errors don't suppress Phase 5 summary.

    - Notes: MIGRATION: Move .agents/youtube.md and .agents/youtube/ from root into content/distribution/youtube/ — YouTube is a distribution channel, not a main agent. Root .agents/ is reserved for main domain agents only. MUST INCLUDE: (1) youtube.md reference -> migrated youtube/ subagents. (2) short-form.md: TikTok/Reels/Shorts formatting (9:16, 1-3s cuts, hook-first), platform-specific pacing, trending sound pairing. (3) social.md reference -> existing tools/social-media/ + platform-native tone adaptation (X concise, LinkedIn professional, Reddit community-native). (4) blog.md reference -> existing seo/ for SEO writing. (5) email.md: newsletter structure, sequence design. (6) podcast.md: audio-first distribution, show notes generation. (7) Monetization routing: affiliates first (market research), then info products ($5-27 cold traffic), then upsell. Q4 seasonality for buying intent.

  - Notes: Automate the "Creator Brain Clone" pattern: bulk download competitor channel transcripts via yt-dlp-helper.sh, store in memory-helper.sh with youtube namespace, enable queryable competitive knowledge base. Extends youtube/channel-intel.md and content/research.md. Key insight from PDF extraction: transcript corpus is the highest-leverage competitive intelligence source, more valuable than metadata alone.

  - Notes: Script that systematically tests seed ranges (e.g. 1000-1010) per prompt, scores outputs via vision model, returns top candidates. Cuts AI video generation costs by ~60% (success rate 15% -> 70%+). Content-type seed ranges: people 1000-1999, action 2000-2999, landscape 3000-3999, product 4000-4999. YouTube-optimized: 2000-3000. Could be a new video-gen-helper.sh or extension of existing tools/video/ tooling. Referenced by content/production/video.md and content/optimization.md.

  - Notes: CLI helper scripts for programmatic access to AI generation APIs, enabling pipeline automation beyond manual UI use. Sora 2 Pro for UGC-style (API via kie.ai or direct), Veo 3.1 for cinematic (ingredients-to-video, NEVER frame-to-video), Nanobanana Pro for structured JSON image gen. Each would follow the existing helper pattern (auth, generate, status, quota). Currently these tools are used via Higgsfield agent and browser; API helpers add headless pipeline optionality. Related: tools/video/higgsfield.md, tools/vision/image-generation.md, content/production/video.md, content/production/image.md.

  - Notes: Extend voice-helper.sh or create voice-pipeline-helper.sh for the 2-step voice post-processing chain: (1) CapCut AI voice cleanup (normalize accents/artifacts from raw AI output), (2) ElevenLabs voice cloning/transformation. Critical: never go directly from AI video output to ElevenLabs — the CapCut step cleans artifacts first. Also supports emotional block cues (per-word emotion tagging) for natural AI speech. Related: tools/voice/speech-to-speech.md, tools/voice/voice-bridge.md, content/production/audio.md.

  - Notes: The core multiplier capability: given one researched story (from content/research.md + content/story.md), automatically generate adaptation briefs for each target channel and media format. Example: "Why 95% of AI influencers fail" -> YouTube long-form script + YouTube Short + blog post outline + X thread + LinkedIn article + Reddit post + newsletter + carousel brief. Each adaptation uses the same hooks/angles but reformats for platform conventions. Orchestration logic lives in content.md, individual adaptations dispatched to content/distribution/ agents. This is the highest-leverage feature of the entire content creation system.

  - Notes: ✅ COMPLETE - thumbnail-helper.sh with 8 style templates (high-contrast-face, text-heavy, before-after, curiosity-gap, product-showcase, cinematic, minimalist, action-packed). Features: automated variant generation (Nanobanana Pro JSON prompts), interactive scoring rubric (6 weighted criteria: face 25%, contrast 20%, text space 15%, brand 15%, emotion 15%, clarity 10%), batch processing, YouTube A/B test setup, performance analysis. Workflow: generate → score → upload passing (>= 7.5/10) → A/B test → analyze CTR. Updated content/optimization.md and content/production/image.md with CLI examples. Added to subagent-index.toon. ShellCheck clean. API integration is placeholder (generates JSON for manual Higgsfield UI use). 931 lines added.

  - Notes: Schedule-aware content planning: (1) maintain a content calendar in memory or SQLite with planned topics, target dates, channels, status. (2) Posting cadence recommendations per platform (YouTube 2-3/week, Shorts daily, blog 1-2/week, social daily). (3) Q4 seasonality awareness for monetization-focused content. (4) Backlog management: research queue -> scripted queue -> produced queue -> scheduled queue -> published. (5) Analytics feedback: what performed well informs next cycle's topic selection. Could be a content-calendar-helper.sh or extension of existing pipeline.

  - Notes: Add Phase 3c to supervisor pulse cycle. For all tasks with status in (complete, retrying, blocked, failed) that have pr_url = 'task_only', 'no_pr', or NULL, run `gh pr list --state open --head feature/tXXX`. If a matching PR is found, update the task's pr_url and transition to pr_review. This session alone found 5 orphaned PRs (t199.2, t199.3, t199.5, t199.4, t199.6) that workers created but the supervisor recorded as task_only/no_pr. Root cause: worker emits TASK_COMPLETE (not FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE), supervisor records task_only; git heuristic finds commits but no PR, also records task_only. The evaluate_worker function doesn't check GitHub for open PRs matching the task's branch. Related memories: mem_20260210014951_9ebbdb39, mem_20260210010909.

  - Notes: validate_pr_belongs_to_task returns "cannot fetch" on transient GitHub API failures (rate limits, network blips). Currently this causes the supervisor to treat the PR as unfetchable and skip validation. Add 2-3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 3s, 9s) before declaring unfetchable. Related memory: mem_20260210005656.

  - Notes: cmd_push() always created issues with status:available even when task had assignee:. cmd_close() never added status:done label. Fix: check assignee in cmd_push() to use status:claimed, add status:done + remove stale labels in cmd_close().
- [x] t213 Auto-deploy agents after supervisor merges PRs that modify .agents/scripts/ #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#888 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T04:28:06Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#916
  - Notes: Cron pulse runs ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/supervisor-helper.sh (deployed copy), not the repo copy. After merging PRs that modify scripts, the deployed copy is stale until setup.sh runs. Fix: add auto-deploy step (rsync from repo to deployed) at pulse start, or after detecting a merge of .agents/scripts/ files. Discovered when t210's orphaned PR scanner and t211's retry logic weren't active despite PRs being merged. Related memory: mem_20260210025609_340e8698.
- [x] t220 Issue-sync must link closing PR when marking tasks complete — all closed issues need auditable PR reference #bugfix #supervisor #workflow ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T16:05:53Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#944
  - Notes: 61 closed issues had no PR link. The issue-sync GHA closes issues when TODO.md tasks are marked [x], but doesn't reference the PR. Fix: (1) update_todo_on_complete() should add pr:#NNN to TODO.md, (2) issue-sync cmd_close() should comment "Completed in PR #NNN" on the issue, (3) supervisor PR lifecycle should use "Closes #NNN" in merge commit when ref:GH# is present. This is critical for audit trail and knowledge retention.

  - Notes: osgrep spawns 4 Node.js child processes per worktree for semantic indexing, consuming ~400% CPU per worker. Workers rarely need semantic search — rg + git ls-files covers 95%+ of use cases. Fix: remove osgrep from worker dispatch MCP config. Keep it for interactive sessions only.
- [x] t222 Fix deploying state stuck — auto-recover when deploy completes but state transition fails #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T16:06:14Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Deploy log shows "Happy server managing!" but supervisor doesn't transition from deploying to deployed. Seen on t217, t214, t218, t219. Root cause: pulse interrupted during deploy, or run_deploy_for_task returns 0 but calling code doesn't complete transition. Fix: if deploying >10min and deploy log ends with success marker, auto-transition to deployed.
- [x] t223 Fix PR cross-contamination — supervisor links wrong PR to wrong task #bugfix #supervisor ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T16:11:45Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: t214 was linked to PR #921 (which belongs to t218). Root cause: orphaned PR scanner or PR detection matched by timing rather than branch name. Fix: verify branch name matches task ID pattern (feature/tNNN) before linking. Also verify PR title contains task ID.
- [x] t224 Pre-dispatch merged PR check — prevent re-queuing already-completed tasks #bugfix #supervisor #dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T16:12:19Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Backlog-14 was entirely wasted — all 8 tasks had merged PRs from previous batches. The supervisor's "already completed in git history" check catches some but not all. Fix: before dispatch, run `gh pr list --state merged --head feature/tNNN` and if a merged PR exists, skip dispatch and mark deployed. Also check TODO.md for existing pr:#NNN field. Memory: mem_20260210133552_2f54588f.
- [x] t225 Serial merge strategy for sibling subtasks — rebase remaining PRs after each merge to prevent cascading conflicts #enhancement #supervisor #merge ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T16:13:03Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Backlog-15's #1 bottleneck: 13 subtasks all touching overlapping files (subagent-index.toon, accessibility.md, accessibility-helper.sh). Each merge invalidated all sibling PRs, requiring manual rebase. Fix: when process_post_pr_lifecycle() merges a PR, check if other tasks in the same batch have open PRs touching overlapping files. If so, auto-rebase them before attempting merge. Or: merge sequentially (one at a time) with auto-rebase between each.

  - Notes: CodeRabbit bot reviews with CHANGES_REQUESTED state block the merge pipeline. The supervisor should auto-dismiss these via `gh api -X PUT repos/.../pulls/N/reviews/ID/dismissals` with message "Auto-dismissed: bot review does not block autonomous pipeline". Only dismiss bot reviews (coderabbitai, gemini-code-assist), never human reviews.

  - Notes: SonarCloud has two checks: (1) SonarCloud Analysis GH Action (runs in CI), (2) SonarCloud Code Analysis (external quality gate). When the GH Action passes but the external gate fails, the PR is UNSTABLE but safe to merge. The supervisor should detect this pattern and merge with --admin flag. Seen on PRs #930, #935, #937 in backlog-15.
- [x] t228 Worker incremental commit protocol — prevent context-exhaustion data loss #bugfix #supervisor #worker ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) pr:#946 logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Workers treat commit/push/PR as the final step. If context runs out before that (as with t221 — 67 tool calls, 3.4MB log, zero commits), all work is lost. Fix: (1) commit after each implementation subtask, (2) create draft PR after first push, (3) supervisor auto-promotes draft PRs when worker dies, (4) offload heavy research to Task sub-agents.

  - Notes: When a worker retries (clean_exit_no_signal), the reprompt worker closes the existing open PR and creates a fresh one. This wastes CI results, review context, and GitHub notification bandwidth. Fix: reprompt should detect existing open PR on the task's branch, push new commits to the same branch, and let the existing PR update. Only create a new PR if none exists.

- [x] t230 Prune duplicate FAILURE_PATTERN memories — 55 entries mostly clean_exit_no_signal duplicates #chore #memory ~30m (ai:20m test:10m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T17:08:47Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Memory stats show 55 FAILURE_PATTERN entries, most are identical clean_exit_no_signal records for different tasks. These add noise without signal. The memory-audit-pulse should consolidate these into a single "clean_exit_no_signal is the #1 failure pattern, seen N times across batches X-Y" entry and prune the duplicates. t181 added dedup on store but didn't retroactively clean existing duplicates.
- [x] t231 Auto-update polling daemon — check for new releases every 10 min and auto-install #feature #framework #auto-update ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#971 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T00:44:10Z logged:2026-02-10 started:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#955
  - Notes: Lightweight cron job (not AI agent dispatch) that polls GitHub for new versions and runs `aidevops update` when available. Lock file prevents concurrent updates. CLI: `aidevops auto-update [enable|disable|status]`. Safe to run while sessions are active — we do this often during development. Opt-in via setup.sh or CLI.
- [x] t232 Centralize PR-to-task linking — single source of truth function `link_pr_to_task()` #bugfix #supervisor #pr-linking ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T17:42:21Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: PR cross-contamination keeps recurring (6 historical duplicates found: PRs #657, #761, #805, #810, #922, #925 each linked to 2 tasks). Root cause: 7 independent code paths write pr_url to the DB, some without validation or proof logging. Fix: create `link_pr_to_task()` that (1) calls validate_pr_belongs_to_task(), (2) checks PR isn't already linked to another task via `SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE pr_url = ?`, (3) writes a proof log entry, (4) only then updates the DB. Replace all 7 raw UPDATE paths: evaluate_worker L5200-5254, process_post_pr_lifecycle L6298+L7465, scan_orphaned_prs L6591, scan_orphaned_pr_for_task L6737, cmd_transition L1793, record_proof_log L321. Add a uniqueness constraint or at minimum a warning when a PR is already claimed.
- [x] t233 Pre-dispatch model availability check — call model-availability-helper.sh before worker dispatch #enhancement #supervisor #dispatch ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T17:42:37Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: 4 ambiguous_ai_unavailable + 5 backend_quota_error failures in DB. model-availability-helper.sh exists but supervisor doesn't call it. Add check in cmd_dispatch() before spawning worker: if provider is unavailable/rate-limited (exit 1/2), defer dispatch and log reason. Saves wasted worker context + compute. Use cached health probes (~1-2s overhead).
- [x] t234 Worker pre-push ShellCheck gate — workers must run ShellCheck on modified .sh files before pushing #enhancement #supervisor #worker #quality ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T17:42:45Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: 3 CI-checks-failed errors in DB. Workers modify shell scripts but don't run ShellCheck before pushing, causing CI failures that waste a retry cycle. Add to worker prompt: after each commit, run `shellcheck` on modified .sh files. If violations found, fix before pushing. This catches issues 5-10 minutes earlier than waiting for CI.
- [x] t235 Proof-log coverage for all pr_url mutations — ensure every DB write has an audit trail #enhancement #supervisor #audit ~45m (ai:30m test:15m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T17:50:18Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10
  - Notes: Proof log (t218) instruments 10+ decision points but misses pr_url mutations in scan_orphaned_prs (L6591), scan_orphaned_pr_for_task (L6737), and process_post_pr_lifecycle (L7465). These unaudited paths are where cross-contamination happens invisibly. If t232 centralizes via link_pr_to_task(), this becomes automatic. Otherwise add record_proof_log calls at each mutation point. blocked-by:t232

  - Notes: 60 tasks in supervisor DB show no_pr/task_only despite having real merged PRs on GitHub. These predate the PR-linking system or used non-standard branch names. Script should: for each deployed/verified task with no_pr, search GitHub for merged PRs matching feature/{task_id} or containing task_id in title, validate via validate_pr_belongs_to_task(), update DB via link_pr_to_task() (t232), and write proof log entries.

  - Notes: 114 deployed/verified tasks have no proof_logs entries (predating t218). 58 have pr_url in DB (need verification that PR was actually merged with substantive changes). 56 have no_pr (need GitHub search + codebase check for deliverables). For each task: (1) verify merged PR exists and contains real code changes (not just TODO.md edits), (2) write retroactive proof_log entry with evidence, (3) flag any tasks that have no verifiable deliverable for human review.

- [x] t247 Reduce clean_exit_no_signal retries — 16 tasks hit this (100% eventually succeeded on retry). Root cause: workers exhaust context window and exit gracefully without signaling. Improvements: (1) add context-remaining check in loop-common.sh that emits FULL_LOOP_COMPLETE before context runs out, (2) increase git heuristic tier coverage to catch more cases before AI eval, (3) if worker has commits on branch but no PR, auto-create PR from supervisor instead of retrying. #reliability #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-11T00:44:02Z ref:GH#1010 logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-11 pr:#1038

  - Notes: evaluate_worker() fallback PR detection (line ~4639) uses `gh pr list --head` to find PRs matching the task's branch. If the branch column in the DB is corrupted (e.g., t194's branch was recorded as feature/t020.6), the wrong PR gets attributed to the wrong task, causing false completion. Fix: after finding a PR via branch match, verify the PR title contains the task ID. If not, log a warning and skip. Discovered when t020.6 was falsely marked complete with t194's PR #810.

  - Notes: Multiple tasks (t072, t132, t134, t135.3-6, t166.2, t181, t182, t184, t191) repeatedly fail with clean_exit_no_signal, burning 3 retries each at Opus cost. Memory shows this is the #1 failure pattern. Possible causes: (1) OpenCode exits 0 even on backend errors, (2) workers complete but don't emit WORKER_COMPLETE signal, (3) workers hit context limits and exit gracefully. Need to analyze log patterns across these failures and add better signal detection or worker instrumentation.
- [x] t194 Daily model registry refresh — detect new/changed model IDs from OpenCode providers #feature #supervisor #model-routing ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#798 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T20:46:06Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 pr:#810
  - Notes: On session start or daily cron, run `opencode models` and compare against hardcoded IDs in supervisor-helper.sh and fallback-chain-config.json.txt. Flag mismatches (new models, deprecated IDs). Also fix model-availability-helper.sh to use `opencode models <provider>` instead of direct API key probing (which fails because OpenCode manages keys internally). Related: PR #796 fixed stale model IDs and openrouter fallback.
- [x] t200 Fix SC2012 in review-pulse-helper.sh — replace `ls` with `find`/`fd` for file discovery #quality #shell ~15m (ai:10m test:5m) ref:GH#821 logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #818 merged
  - Notes: CodeRabbit pulse review (issue #753) found 3 instances of `ls` where `find` should be used (SC2012). Lines 378, 451 use `ls -t` to find latest findings file; line 555 uses `ls | wc -l` to count files. Replace with `find`+`sort` or `fd` patterns. Other CodeRabbit findings (SC2086 in wp-helper.sh, SC2034 unused colors) were verified as false positives. Originally t196, renumbered to t200 due to parallel session collision.
- [x] t205 Add AGENTS.md rule: re-verify task ID after git pull --rebase before push #docs #workflow #quality ~15m (ai:10m) logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #820 merged
  - Notes: Race condition hit twice in one session — parallel sessions created t195 and t196 simultaneously, causing duplicate IDs in TODO.md. Root cause: agent assigns next ID, commits, push fails, does pull --rebase, pushes again WITHOUT re-checking if the ID is still free. Fix: added rule to AGENTS.md Planning & Tasks section. Originally t201, renumbered to t205 due to parallel session collision (ironic).
- [x] t189 Worktree ownership safety — prevent sessions from removing worktrees owned by other parallel sessions #bugfix #git #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#692 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:24:23Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #695 merged
  - [x] t189.1 Add worktree ownership registry ~45m blocked-by:none pr:#695
    - Notes: When a session creates or claims a worktree, register it in a SQLite table or lockfile: worktree path, session ID, PID, task ID, created timestamp. Before removing any worktree, check the registry — if another session owns it and its PID is still alive, REFUSE to remove. If PID is dead but session is recent (<1h), WARN and require --force. This prevents the exact bug that happened: supervisor session cleaned up a worktree that a parallel interactive session was actively using.
  - [x] t189.2 Add "in use" detection to worktree cleanup ~30m blocked-by:t189.1 pr:#695
    - Notes: Before `git worktree remove`, check: (1) is any process with CWD inside the worktree? (`lsof +D` or `fuser`), (2) is the worktree registered to another session?, (3) are there uncommitted changes? Only remove if all three are clear. Add --force to override (with warning). Wire into supervisor cleanup, `wt merge`, and any other worktree removal paths.
  - [x] t189.3 Add AGENTS.md rule: never remove worktrees you didn't create ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#695
    - Notes: Immediate instruction-level fix. Add to AGENTS.md: "NEVER remove a worktree unless (a) you created it in this session, (b) it belongs to a task you are managing, or (c) the user explicitly asks. Worktrees may belong to parallel sessions — removing them destroys another agent's working directory." This is the cheapest fix and should be done first.
  - [x] t189.4 Scope batch cleanup to batch-owned worktrees only ~30m blocked-by:none pr:#695
    - Notes: The supervisor's worktree cleanup during pulse should ONLY touch worktrees for tasks in the current batch. Currently it can discover and remove any worktree matching the naming pattern. Add batch_id filtering: only clean worktrees whose task_id is in the batch being pulsed.
  - Notes: Root cause from 2026-02-09: supervisor session force-removed a worktree (`bugfix/setup-template-opencode-install`) that belonged to a parallel interactive session. The branch survived but the other session lost its working directory and had to restart. Git workflow protects code (branches survive), but the worktree directory is the active workspace — losing it mid-session is disruptive. Three layers of fix needed: (1) instruction-level rule (t189.3, cheapest), (2) ownership registry (t189.1, most robust), (3) in-use detection (t189.2, defense in depth).
- [x] t187 Compaction-resilient session state — ensure critical context survives LLM context compaction #feature #framework #self-improvement ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#686 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:59:21Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #699 merged
  - [x] t187.1 Add compaction survival instruction to AGENTS.md/build.txt ~30m blocked-by:none pr:#699
    - Notes: Add an instruction that is always preserved through compaction summaries. Something like "When summarizing this conversation for compaction, ALWAYS include: current batch ID, active task IDs and their states, worktree paths, and the next 3 action items." This ensures the model retains operational state even after aggressive compaction. Test by verifying the instruction appears in compaction output.
  - [x] t187.2 Add session-state checkpoint command ~1h blocked-by:none pr:#699
    - Notes: Create a `/checkpoint` command that outputs a structured continuation prompt (like the one used to resume this session). Format: batch state, task statuses, worktree list, open PRs, next steps, user preferences. Can be auto-generated at session end or on demand. Store in memory for cross-session recall. This is the single highest-impact factor for session continuity through compaction.
  - [x] t187.3 Enhance session-distill to capture operational state ~30m blocked-by:t187.2 pr:#699
    - Notes: Current session-distill captures learnings but not operational state (which tasks are running, what PRs need review). Extend to also emit a checkpoint block that can be fed back as a continuation prompt.
  - Notes: Lesson from 2026-02-09 session: continuation prompt was the single biggest factor in surviving compaction. AGENTS.md provides the "how" (conventions, tools), but the continuation prompt provides the "where we are" (task states, batch IDs, next steps). Without it, the agent can operate the framework but doesn't know what to work on. Tool outputs (supervisor status, git log, gh pr list) can partially reconstruct state but are slower and lossy.
- [x] t188 Pre-migration safety backups for non-git state — backup DBs and local state before destructive operations #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#687 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T00:41:26Z logged:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #697 merged
  - [x] t188.1 Add automatic backup before schema migrations ~30m blocked-by:none pr:#697
    - Notes: The t180 migration already calls backup_db() but the INSERT INTO tasks SELECT * FROM tasks_old_t180 silently failed, leaving the tasks table empty. Need: (a) verify row count after migration matches before, (b) rollback if mismatch, (c) keep backup until next successful pulse confirms data integrity. The backup existed and saved us — but the migration should have caught its own failure.
  - [x] t188.2 Add backup-before-modify pattern for non-git state ~30m blocked-by:none pr:#697
    - Notes: Git workflow protects code files, but SQLite DBs, memory stores, and config files aren't version-controlled. Pattern: before any destructive operation on non-git state (schema migration, bulk prune, consolidate), create a timestamped backup, verify the operation succeeded, and only clean up the backup after the next successful operation confirms integrity. This is what saved the supervisor DB today — the backup_db() call in the migration created a restore point.
  - [x] t188.3 Add backup cleanup on successful verification ~15m blocked-by:t188.1 pr:#697
    - Notes: Backups accumulate. After a successful pulse confirms task data is intact (row count matches batch_tasks), clean up backups older than 24h. Keep the most recent backup always.
  - Notes: Lesson from 2026-02-09: t180 schema migration emptied the tasks table (INSERT from renamed table silently failed). The backup_db() call saved us — we restored 60 tasks from the pre-migration backup. Git workflow wouldn't have caught this because SQLite DBs are gitignored. Non-git state needs its own safety net.
- [x] t186 Add development lifecycle enforcement to AGENTS.md — all work must create TODO entry and either full-loop or queue for runners #docs #workflow #quality ~30m (ai:20m) ref:GH#682 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T01:08:14Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #700 merged
  - Notes: Development work was being done without TODO entries and without full-loop testing. Rule added to AGENTS.md: every change must (1) have a TODO entry, (2) ask user whether to implement now or queue, (3) if implementing, follow full-loop (plan->implement->test->verify->deliver). Prevents shipping untested code.
- [x] t185 Memory audit pulse — periodic scan of memories for self-improvement opportunities #feature #memory #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#675 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T23:42:46Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #691 merged
  - [x] t185.1 Add memory-audit command to memory-helper.sh ~45m blocked-by:none pr:#691
    - Notes: New command that scans all memories and produces actionable output. Logic: (1) Find recurring patterns — same error type 3+ times across different tasks = needs a fix task. (2) Check FAILED_APPROACH memories against merged PRs — if the referenced PR/issue is resolved, mark memory as graduated. (3) Identify DECISION/CODEBASE_PATTERN memories not yet in shared docs — flag for graduation. (4) Detect duplicates and near-duplicates for pruning. Output: structured report with proposed TODOs, graduation candidates, and prune candidates.
  - [x] t185.2 Wire memory audit into supervisor pulse as periodic phase ~30m blocked-by:t185.1 pr:#691
    - Notes: Add Phase 9 to pulse cycle (after issue-sync Phase 8). Run memory-audit every N pulses (e.g. every 50th pulse = ~every 4 hours with 5-min cron). When recurring patterns found, auto-create TODO entries with ref to the memory IDs. When graduation candidates found, create t184-style tasks. When prune candidates found, auto-prune with log.
  - [x] t185.3 Add memory lifecycle states (active/graduated/pruned) ~30m blocked-by:t185.1 pr:#691
    - Notes: Add status column to learnings table: active (default), graduated (moved to docs, link to file:line), pruned (resolved, link to PR#). Graduated memories stay in DB as audit trail but don't appear in recall. This enables the full lifecycle: capture -> validate -> graduate -> prune.
  - Notes: Closes the self-improvement loop. Currently memories accumulate but nothing reviews them for action. This session manually audited 881 memories down to 26, created 6 tasks (t179-t184), and pruned 855 entries. That process should be automated. The pulse checks for: recurring errors needing fix tasks, resolved issues to prune, validated learnings to graduate into shared docs.

  - [x] t184.1 Add supervisor architecture decisions to architecture.md ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#689
    - Notes: 7 DECISION memories about supervisor role (pure control plane, never does worker tasks, self-improving dispatch loop), agent tiers (draft/custom/shared), evaluation priority order, concurrency limits. These are framework-defining decisions that new users and contributors need.
  - [x] t184.2 Add macOS bash 3.2 constraints and model routing to code-standards.md ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#689
    - Notes: No associative arrays, grep-based key=value parsing, heuristic eval gated on non-zero exit. Model routing: Opus for race conditions/bugs, Sonnet for features, Haiku misses edge cases on complex shell. Also: worktree rebase before push pattern.
  - [x] t184.3 Add cherry-pick recovery and curl verification limits to relevant subagents ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#689
    - Notes: Cherry-pick recovery (gh pr view --json commits -> git fetch -> cherry-pick) goes in conflict-resolution.md. Curl/HTTP status code limitation (200 on React crash) goes in browser-automation.md verification section.
  - [x] t184.4 Add memory graduation workflow to build-agent.md ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#689
    - Notes: Document the pattern: memories are a staging area for learnings. Once validated (fix merged, pattern confirmed), graduate into shared docs. Add /graduate-memories command or integrate into session-review. Prevents knowledge staying local.
  - Notes: Memory audit found 26 useful learnings that only exist locally. 7 architecture decisions, 5 codebase patterns, 3 model routing insights, and recovery techniques that would help all aidevops users. These need to move from SQLite memory into shipped docs.
- [x] t180 Post-merge verification via todo/VERIFY.md — dispatch verification workers after PR merge to confirm deliverables work #feature #supervisor #quality ~3h (ai:2h test:1h) ref:GH#670 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T22:38:20Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #679 merged
  - [x] t180.1 Add verify states to supervisor state machine (merged -> verifying -> verified/verify_failed) ~1h blocked-by:none pr:#679
    - Notes: New states between merged and deployed. On merge, supervisor auto-appends entry to todo/VERIFY.md with task ID, PR number, changed files, and auto-generated check commands. Dispatch a verification worker that runs the checks. If verify fails, task goes to verify_failed and reopens the TODO.md task with a bugfix note.
  - [x] t180.2 Create VERIFY.md auto-population in supervisor merge phase ~30m blocked-by:t180.1 pr:#679
    - Notes: After PR merge, supervisor extracts: changed files from PR, generates check commands (shellcheck for .sh, file-exists for .md, rg for index references), appends to todo/VERIFY.md. Format is TOON-style with check: directives per entry.
  - [x] t180.3 Create verification worker prompt and dispatch logic ~30m blocked-by:t180.1 pr:#679
    - Notes: Lightweight worker reads todo/VERIFY.md, runs each check: directive, marks [x] (pass) or [!] (fail) with evidence. On fail, reopens original task in TODO.md and creates follow-up bugfix task. On pass, supervisor transitions to deployed and marks TODO.md [x].
  - [x] t180.4 Wire verify phase into pulse cycle ~30m blocked-by:t180.1 pr:#679
    - Notes: After merge phase, auto-dispatch verify worker for entries in VERIFY.md. Only transition to deployed after verify passes. Add --skip-verify flag for trusted/trivial tasks. Batch verify multiple tasks in single worker dispatch for efficiency.
  - Notes: Root cause: 12 GitHub issues were open for tasks marked [x] that were never verified. Memory audit revealed pattern of tasks marked complete without checking deliverables actually work. Design: todo/VERIFY.md acts as a verification queue with machine-parseable check directives. Workers verify, supervisor acts on results.

    - Notes: Before inserting, check if a memory with identical or near-identical content already exists (fuzzy match using word overlap, similar to consolidate). Skip insert if >90% match. Currently 23 copies of "Failed: Task blocked" exist.
  - [x] t181.2 Cap supervisor retry/pulse log memories ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#681
    - Notes: Auto-distill and supervisor retry logging create duplicate entries every pulse cycle. Either: (a) only store first occurrence of each retry pattern per task, or (b) update existing memory instead of creating new one, or (c) use a separate retry_log table instead of learnings.
  - [x] t181.3 Auto-prune memories for issues that have been fixed ~15m blocked-by:none pr:#681
    - Notes: When a PR merges that fixes an issue referenced in a memory, mark those memories as resolved/stale. Could tag with PR# and auto-archive on merge. Currently 350 ERROR_FIX memories, many for issues fixed weeks ago.
  - Notes: 881 memories, 654 auto-captured, massive duplication. Top duplicate: "Failed: Task blocked" x23. Auto-distill creates identical entries across pulse cycles. Memory is becoming noise rather than signal.

  - Notes: "Monitor & Auto-Fix Code Quality" GHA workflow re-introduced a ShellCheck bug in clawdhub-helper.sh by adding invalid "|| exit" after "then" clauses. The bot's fix patterns need validation against ShellCheck/linters before committing. Options: (a) disable auto-fix for shell scripts, (b) add ShellCheck validation step after auto-fix, (c) require PR instead of direct commit for auto-fixes.
- [x] t183 Fix supervisor no_log_file dispatch failures — improve error capture when worker fails to start #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#673 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-08T23:07:23Z logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #685 merged
  - Notes: Many tasks fail with no_log_file — dispatch runs but produces no log. Root cause likely: dispatch command fails silently before worker starts (e.g. opencode binary not found, worktree creation fails, prompt too long). Need: (a) capture stderr from dispatch command, (b) write a minimal log entry even on dispatch failure, (c) distinguish "worker never started" from "worker started but log missing".

  - [x] t179.3 Wire issue-sync close into supervisor pulse cycle as periodic reconciliation ~30m blocked-by:t179.1 pr:#677
    - Notes: Add Phase 8 to pulse cycle: run issue-sync-helper.sh close after TODO reconciliation (Phase 7). Only run when no workers active (same guard as reconcile-todo). Prevents stale issues accumulating between manual syncs.
  - [x] t179.4 Add issue-sync close to postflight/session-review checklist ~15m blocked-by:t179.1 pr:#677
    - Notes: After PR merge and TODO update, remind to check issue sync. Or auto-run close as part of postflight.
  - Notes: Root cause discovered 2026-02-08: 12 GitHub issues were open for completed tasks because ref:GH# values in TODO.md didn't match actual issue numbers (issues recreated with new numbers by push command). The GHA workflow runs close on push but uses ref:GH# for lookup, missing the mismatched issues. Also fixed: task ID grep truncation bug (t131 matching t131.vision) in PR #668.

    - Notes: Parse opencode.json and provider configs to list available models. Categorise as free vs paid. For /compare-models, prompt user to select 2+ models from any provider. For /compare-models-free, auto-select all free-tier models. Use model-routing.md tiers as reference. Need to handle provider auth (some models need API keys, free models may not).

    - Notes: For each model, dispatch the user's test task as a subagent call (Task tool with model-specific subagent). Run in-session via parallel Task tool calls where possible. For long-running comparisons (large tasks, many models), support fallback to headless dispatch via supervisor with results collected via mailbox. Each model gets identical prompt + context. Capture: response text, token count, latency, any errors. The main session model orchestrates but does NOT participate in the comparison itself.

    - Notes: Main session model evaluates all responses side-by-side. Criteria: correctness, completeness, code quality (if code task), clarity, adherence to instructions. Output structured comparison table (model, score, strengths, weaknesses, latency, tokens). Support both text tasks and code tasks. Store results in memory for cross-session model selection insights.

    - Notes: Slash commands created in PR #660 (compare-models.md, compare-models-free.md, score-responses.md). Scoring framework wired in PR #773 (compare-models-helper.sh score/results commands) and response-scoring-helper.sh. All three commands reference correct helpers and are functional.
  - Notes: Single-session workflow: user invokes command, selects models (or auto-selects free), provides task, subagents execute in parallel, main model compares results. For long-running tasks (>2min per model), fall back to headless dispatch with supervisor collecting results. Builds on t132 (model routing) infrastructure. Key constraint: the evaluating model should not be one of the compared models to avoid bias. Free models vary by provider - OpenRouter, Google (Gemini Flash), Anthropic (Haiku via free tier), Groq, etc.

Could also integrate other review bots (Codacy, SonarCloud) as additional signal sources. **t167 research confirms Gemini CLI as viable additional signal source** -- add subtask for gemini-cli integration alongside CodeRabbit. Gemini CLI is free (1000 req/day), local, and avoids PR-only limitation of GitHub bot.
- [x] t167 Investigate Gemini Code Assist for full codebase review in daily pulse #quality #automation #research ~30m (ai:20m read:10m) ref:GH#625 assignee:marcusquinn logged:2026-02-08 started:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 verified:2026-02-08 PR #650 merged
  - Notes: **Research complete (2026-02-08).** Gemini Code Assist GitHub bot (`gemini-code-assist[bot]`) only reviews PR diffs -- confirmed via official docs (developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code, updated 2026-02-02). No full codebase review API or trigger exists. Commands limited to `/gemini review`, `/gemini summary`, `@gemini-code-assist` -- all PR-scoped. Consumer quota: 33 PR reviews/day; Enterprise: 100+/day. **Three approaches evaluated:**
  - **Option 1: Synthetic full-diff PR** -- Create branch from empty tree (`git commit-tree $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)`), PR against main. Forces Gemini to review entire codebase as a "diff". VIABLE but hacky: creates noise in PR history, may hit review size limits, 33/day consumer quota means 1 daily review is feasible. Recommended as interim approach for t166 integration.
  - **Option 2: Gemini CLI (gemini-cli)** -- Open-source CLI agent with ReAct loop, file read/write, MCP support. Free tier: 1000 requests/day, 60/min. Can be prompted to review codebase locally without GitHub bot. MOST VIABLE for daily pulse: run `gemini review the codebase for quality issues` in repo dir, parse structured output. No PR needed. Integrates via supervisor dispatch like any other CLI tool.
  - **Option 3: Gemini API directly** -- Use Gemini 3 Pro/Flash via API with 1M token context window. Feed repo contents, get structured review. VIABLE but requires API key management and custom integration code. Higher cost than CLI approach.
  - **Recommendation:** Option 2 (Gemini CLI) is the best path for t166 integration. It's free, local, scriptable, and avoids the PR-only limitation of the GitHub bot. Add as t166 subtask: `gemini-cli-helper.sh review` command that runs Gemini CLI codebase review, parses output into same structured format as CodeRabbit findings. Option 1 (synthetic PR) is a viable fallback if CLI output quality is insufficient. Option 3 is overkill for this use case.
  - **Quality assessment:** Gemini's review on PR #622 caught a real regex issue (high severity) but also produced false positives. Same bot-review verification rules from t166.2 apply. Gemini focuses on: correctness, efficiency, maintainability, security. Customizable via `.gemini/styleguide.md` (already have `.gemini/settings.json` in repo). Enterprise version supports cross-repo style guides via Google Cloud console.
- [x] t158 Fix supervisor dispatch so dynamically-created tasks work with /full-loop #bugfix #supervisor #orchestration ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#573 logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 verified:2026-02-08 PR #574 merged
  - Notes: Problem: supervisor adds tasks to its DB but not to TODO.md, so workers running /full-loop cannot find the task description. Fix: 1) build_dispatch_cmd now passes task description inline in the prompt (` -- description`), 2) full-loop.md Step 0 has 3-tier resolution: inline desc > TODO.md > supervisor DB, 3) full-loop-helper.sh PR creation queries supervisor DB as fallback. Also adds headless worker rules (no user prompts, no TODO.md edits, graceful auth failure handling) and PR creation hardening (gh auth check, rebase before push, proper title/body).
- [x] t160 fix: supervisor TODO.md push fails under concurrent workers, add reconcile-todo command #bugfix #supervisor ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#579 logged:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 verified:2026-02-08 PR #589 merged
  - Notes: Root cause: update_todo_on_complete() commits TODO.md locally but git push fails when multiple concurrent workers push to main simultaneously (non-fast-forward). The function logs a warning but treats it as non-blocking, so tasks transition to deployed even though TODO.md was never pushed. Fix: add commit_and_push_todo() helper with pull-rebase retry logic (3 attempts with backoff). Add reconcile-todo command for bulk reconciliation. Wire reconcile into pulse cycle Phase 7 (runs when no workers active). Affected 12 tasks from batch-20260208.
- [x] t162 fix: supervisor DB safety - add backup-before-migrate and explicit column migrations #bugfix #supervisor ~30m (ai:25m test:5m) ref:GH#590 logged:2026-02-08 started:2026-02-08 completed:2026-02-08 pr:#591
  - Notes: Root cause: t128.8 migration uses INSERT INTO tasks SELECT * FROM tasks_old which fails on column count mismatch if migrations run out of order. No backup before destructive table rename/recreate migrations. Fix: 1) Add backup_db() helper with SQLite .backup, timestamped copies, auto-prune to 5. 2) Add backup before t128.8 and t148 destructive migrations. 3) Fix t128.8 SELECT * to use explicit column list. 4) Add backup/restore commands for manual recovery.

    - Notes: check_system_load() at line 197, calculate_adaptive_concurrency() at line 310, resource stats in pulse Phase 5 summary, max_load_factor column in batches table with migration.
    - Notes: Discovered during batch-20260207 run: 3 concurrent workers spawned 51 opencode + 149 node processes, load avg hit 116 on 10-core machine. Supervisor has model health checks and orphan cleanup but no system resource awareness. Each opencode worker spawns ~15-20 sub-processes (MCP servers, LSPs). Need: load average monitoring, process count per worker, adaptive concurrency (pause dispatch when overloaded, resume when load drops).
  - Notes: From Claude Opus 4.6 codebase review (2026-02-07). Review corrected: 100/170 scripts already have set -e (not 2 as initially reported). 29/170 use shared-constants.sh. 95 scripts have blanket 20+ rule ShellCheck disable. 12 fix scripts have 0 references and only exist from the .agent->.agents rename commit. All subtasks designed for /runners dispatch. IMPORTANT: Review recommendation #10 (organize scripts by domain subdirectories) was REJECTED - scripts are cross-domain and flat namespace with naming convention is the intentional design. Recommendation #13 (remove dead fix scripts) changed to ARCHIVE non-destructively. Every subtask requires reading existing code to understand intent before changes.

    - Notes: OpenCode supports per-agent model selection natively -- the Task tool doesn't accept a model param, but each subagent definition can specify its own model. Create subagents like gemini-reviewer (google/gemini-3-pro-preview), gemini-analyst (google/gemini-3-flash-preview), gpt-reviewer (openai/gpt-4.1), etc. Map existing model-routing.md tiers (haiku/flash/sonnet/pro/opus) to concrete agent definitions. Primary agent selects model by choosing which subagent to invoke.

    - Notes: OpenCode provider/model names change (new models released, old ones deprecated, naming conventions shift). Create model-registry-helper.sh that: 1) Scrapes available models from OpenCode config / Models.dev / provider APIs, 2) Compares against our configured models in opencode.json and model-routing.md, 3) Flags deprecated/renamed/unavailable models, 4) Suggests new models worth adding. Run periodically (cron or manual) and on `aidevops update`. Store registry in SQLite alongside memory/mail DBs.

    - Notes: PR #781 merged. fallback-chain-helper.sh and fallback-chain-config.json.txt implement per-agent and global fallback chains with gateway provider support (OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway). Triggers: API error, timeout, rate limit, empty response.

    - Notes: PR #788 merged. Added get_next_tier(), check_output_quality(), run_quality_gate() to supervisor-helper.sh. Heuristic quality checks (log size, error patterns, file changes, syntax errors, token-to-substance ratio). Escalation chain: haiku->sonnet->opus, flash->pro. Schema: escalation_depth/max_escalation on tasks, skip_quality_gate on batches. --skip-quality-gate flag on batch command.

    - Notes: PR #789 merged. Added resolve_model_tier() and detect_ai_backends() to shared-constants.sh. Runner and cron helpers now accept tier names (haiku/sonnet/opus/flash/pro/grok) in --model flag. New --provider flag for provider override. cron-dispatch.sh now sources shared-constants.sh.
  - [x] t132.8 Cross-model review workflow (second-opinion pattern) ~2h blocked-by:t132.7 ref:GH#740 completed:2026-02-09 pr:#791
    - Notes: PR #791 merged. Added cross-review command to compare-models-helper.sh. Dispatches same prompt to N models in parallel via runner-helper.sh, collects results, generates word count comparison and unified diff. Default models: sonnet,opus. Configurable --models, --timeout, --workdir, --output.
  - Notes: OpenCode already supports per-agent model selection (each agent definition can have its own `model:` field across 75+ providers). The Task tool selects a model by invoking a subagent that has that model configured -- not via a model parameter on the call itself. Currently model-routing.md exists as design doc and all 195 subagents have model: frontmatter, but no corresponding agent definitions in opencode.json enforce it. Runner --model only works with single hardcoded provider. No fallback on failure, no availability checking, no quality-based escalation. Provider/model names are a moving target and need periodic reconciliation. This blocks use cases like "get a Gemini review of the codebase from within a Claude session."

    - Notes: Workers exit after PR creation (context limit). Supervisor detects PR-complete tasks and handles remaining stages: wait for CI, merge (squash), postflight, deploy. Implemented as pulse Phase 3 with transition command. PR #392 merged.
  - [x] t128.9 Agent-review and session-review integration ~2h blocked-by:t128.7 completed:2026-02-08
    - Notes: Added run_session_review() to supervisor-helper.sh. On batch completion: captures session context via session-review-helper.sh json, extracts learnings via session-distill-helper.sh auto, stores memory snapshot, suggests @agent-review as non-blocking recommendation. Hooked into check_batch_completion() after run_batch_retrospective(). All calls non-blocking. PR #494 merged.
  - [x] t128.10 Automatic release at batch milestones ~2h blocked-by:t128.8 completed:2026-02-08
    - Notes: Already implemented: trigger_batch_release() handles version-manager.sh release, check_batch_completion() calls it when release_on_complete flag is set, cmd_release() provides manual control. Schema has release_on_complete and release_type columns. cmd_batch accepts --release-on-complete and --release-type flags. Verified complete.

  - Notes: Previously closed 2026-02-07 as "no public repo found". Repo is now public (9.9k stars, AGPL-3.0, actively maintained). Shannon is a fully autonomous AI pentester: white-box source-aware, Docker-based, covers Injection/XSS/SSRF/Broken Auth, 96.15% XBOW benchmark success rate, uses Claude as reasoning engine, produces pentester-grade reports with reproducible PoCs. Runs ~1-1.5h per scan, ~$50/run on Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Integration plan: create .agents/tools/security/shannon.md subagent, add shannon-helper.sh wrapper script, document setup (Docker + Anthropic API key), wire into preflight/postflight or standalone /pentest command.

  - Notes: Dexter (11.4k stars, TypeScript, actively maintained Feb 2026). Autonomous agent for deep financial research with task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data (Financial Datasets API + Exa). Uses Bun runtime + OpenAI. Evaluation: 1) Too domain-specific for core aidevops (financial data APIs only), 2) Task planning/self-validation patterns already implemented in supervisor and ralph-loop, 3) Could be imported as optional skill for finance-focused users. Recommendation: No integration needed. Users can install directly if needed.

  - Notes: Weave (14 stars, Rust, MIT, early development). Intercepts system calls to make execution deterministic (time, RNG, thread scheduling). Only supports Darwin/arm64 and Linux/x86. Evaluation: 1) Interesting concept but too early-stage (limited platform support, small community), 2) aidevops agents are inherently non-deterministic (LLM responses vary) so deterministic syscalls alone don't help, 3) Better suited for traditional software testing than AI agent debugging. Recommendation: Monitor for maturity, no integration now.

  - Notes: progressive-memory (0 stars, Shell, MIT): Filesystem-based progressive disclosure for agent memory. Uses 3-level files (one-liner / summary / full detail) loaded via head/sed/cat. clawdbot (0 stars): Multi-platform AI assistant, minimal content. Evaluation: 1) Progressive disclosure pattern is sound -- aidevops already uses this for subagents (AI-CONTEXT-START blocks, YAML frontmatter), 2) aidevops memory-helper.sh with SQLite FTS5 is more capable (search, consolidation, auto-capture, cross-session), 3) The filesystem approach is simpler but doesn't scale for search/dedup. Recommendation: No adoption needed. aidevops already implements the progressive disclosure pattern more robustly.

- [x] t060 Research jj (Jujutsu) VCS for aidevops advantages #research #git #tools ~15m (ai:10m read:5m) ref:GH#514 logged:2026-01-13 ref:https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj verified:2026-02-08
  - Notes: Git-compatible VCS (25.6k stars, v0.38.0, Apache-2.0, 300+ contributors, backed by Google). Written in Rust, uses gitoxide for Git backend. Key features: working-copy-as-commit (no staging area), operation log with full undo, conflicts as first-class objects, automatic rebase of descendants, anonymous branches (bookmarks), revset query language, safe concurrent replication.
  - Evaluation for aidevops:
    - RECOMMENDED: Colocated mode (`jj git init --colocate`) as bridge strategy. Maintains full git compatibility (all 39 scripts + 67 docs still work), allows gradual adoption, preserves GitHub/CI integration. jj and git commands work interchangeably in same repo.
    - HIGH VALUE: Operation log + undo eliminates the destructive command risk that spawned t009 (PreToolUse hooks). `jj undo` reverses any operation including the equivalent of `git reset --hard`. Would reduce need for pre-edit-check.sh defensive machinery (206 lines).
    - HIGH VALUE: jj workspaces (`jj workspace add`) are lighter than git worktrees. Could simplify the 3-tier fallback chain (wt -> worktree-helper.sh -> raw git worktree) in supervisor-helper.sh parallel dispatch.
    - MEDIUM VALUE: No staging area simplifies commit workflow. Working copy is always a commit, eliminating "dirty working copy" errors and `git stash` usage (7 files). Automatic rebase of descendants eliminates manual `git rebase main` after fetching (9 files).
    - MEDIUM VALUE: First-class conflicts enable committing conflicted state, resolving later. Valuable for supervisor parallel task dispatch where agents touch overlapping files. Conflict resolution propagates through descendants automatically.
    - MEDIUM VALUE: Change IDs persist through squash-merge/rebase/amend, solving the squash-merge detection problem in worktree-helper.sh `cmd_clean()` (currently uses fragile heuristics).
    - CONCERN: No git hooks support yet (issue #405). Pre-commit hooks are used by aidevops for quality gates. Workaround: run linters via jj's `run` command (design doc exists) or keep colocated mode where git hooks still fire.
    - CONCERN: No git submodules support yet. Not a blocker for aidevops (no submodules used).
    - CONCERN: No .gitattributes support (issue #53). Minor impact.
    - CONCERN: Still experimental (pre-1.0). Core devs use it daily, but storage format may change before 1.0. Colocated mode mitigates this -- can always fall back to pure git.
    - CONCERN: Learning curve for team. jj concepts (changes vs commits, bookmarks vs branches, revsets) differ from git mental model. Mitigated by colocated mode allowing gradual adoption.
  - Recommendation: Add jj as OPTIONAL tool in setup.sh alongside Worktrunk. Create a `tools/git/jj.md` subagent documenting jj equivalents for common aidevops git operations. Do NOT replace git -- use colocated mode as an enhancement layer. Revisit after jj 1.0 for deeper integration.
  - Follow-up tasks: t060.1 Add jj installation to setup.sh (optional), t060.2 Create tools/git/jj.md subagent, t060.3 Test jj colocated mode with supervisor parallel dispatch.

  - Notes: Vercel's Agent Skills collection (19.4k stars, MIT, 117 commits, 17 contributors). Now 5 skills: react-best-practices (57 rules, 8 categories), web-design-guidelines (100+ rules), react-native-guidelines (16 rules), composition-patterns, vercel-deploy-claimable. Follows agentskills.io format (SKILL.md structure). agentskills.io is now an open standard adopted by 27+ tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.).
  - Decision: 1) vercel-deploy-claimable: SKIP - designed for claude.ai/Desktop conversations, not CLI agents. aidevops already has full Vercel CLI integration (tools/deployment/vercel.md + vercel-cli-helper.sh) which is more capable. 2) react-best-practices: CANDIDATE for import via `/add-skill vercel-labs/agent-skills` - 57 rules would complement existing code-standards. Create follow-up task. 3) Agent Skills format: ALREADY ADOPTED - aidevops already generates SKILL.md stubs via generate-skills.sh and imports external skills via add-skill-helper.sh. Full compatibility exists. 4) Contribute back: DEFERRED - aidevops skills use progressive disclosure pattern with subagent folders, which is compatible but more complex than typical SKILL.md. Consider contributing simpler skills (mermaid-diagrams, seo-audit) when the ecosystem matures.

- [-] t099 ~~Add Neural-Chromium for agent-native browser automation~~ #tools #browser #ai #automation ~2h logged:2026-01-30 declined:2026-02-05
  - Notes: DECLINED - Neural-Chromium has only 4 stars, no releases, and is Windows-only. Not viable for macOS/Linux users. Better alternatives: browser-use (77.8k stars, cross-platform), Stagehand (20.8k stars, already documented), Skyvern (20.3k stars). The existing neural-chromium.md subagent should be removed. Features: 1.3s interaction latency (4.7x faster than Playwright), semantic DOM understanding via accessibility tree, VLM-powered vision (Llama 3.2 via Ollama), stealth capabilities (no navigator.webdriver), deep iframe access. Uses shared memory + gRPC for direct browser state access. Tools: click(element_id), type(element_id, text), observe() for DOM snapshots. Early stage but promising for agent automation. Evaluate for: CAPTCHA solving, dynamic SPA interaction, form filling. Add to tools/browser/ as experimental option.

Session trees (branching/rewinding) are interesting but require agent-level support. Recommended: document "remix" skill pattern, add desktop notification pattern for long tasks.
  - Notes: Review complete. See todo/research/pi-agent-review.md. Key findings: Pi's minimal 4-tool core validates aidevops's on-demand MCP loading. Session trees (branching/rewinding) are the most interesting feature aidevops lacks but can't implement without agent-level support. Extension hot-reload is powerful but different architecture from aidevops's markdown subagents. Recommended: document "remix" skill pattern in build-agent.md, add desktop notification pattern for long tasks. Skip: removing MCP, rewriting in TypeScript.

  - Notes: Tirith (1,300 stars, Rust, AGPL-3.0) - also see t104 plan: Tirith's `tirith run` command provides verified download-then-execute as the implementation vehicle for curl|sh hardening. - terminal security tool that catches attacks browsers block but terminals don't. **30 rules across 7 categories:** 1) Homograph attacks (Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes, punycode, mixed-script). 2) Terminal injection (ANSI escapes, bidi overrides, zero-width chars). 3) Pipe-to-shell (`curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `eval $(wget ...)`). 4) Dotfile attacks (downloads targeting ~/.bashrc, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). 5) Insecure transport (HTTP piped to shell, `curl -k`). 6) Ecosystem threats (git clone typosquats, untrusted Docker registries, pip/npm URL installs). 7) Credential exposure (userinfo tricks, shortened URLs). **Integration options:** 1) Add to aidevops setup/onboarding as recommended install. 2) Create tirith.md subagent at tools/security/. 3) Document shell hook setup (`eval "$(tirith init)"`). 4) Consider MCP wrapper for `tirith check` command validation. **Key features:** Sub-millisecond overhead, local-only (no network calls), YAML policy config, bypass with `TIRITH=0` prefix. Install: `brew install sheeki03/tap/tirith` or `npm install -g tirith` or `cargo install tirith`.

    - Notes: SOPS (20.7k stars, CNCF sandbox, Mozilla-origin) encrypts values in YAML/JSON/ENV files while keeping structure visible in diffs/PRs. Use age as default backend (simpler than GPG for new users, gopass GPG keys also supported). Create subagent at tools/credentials/sops.md covering: install (brew install sops age), init per-project (.sops.yaml), encrypt/decrypt workflow, key rotation, integration with aidevops secret run for subprocess injection.

    - Notes: Update gopass.md and api-key-setup.md with encryption stack overview: gopass (secret values), SOPS (config files in repos), gocryptfs (local folders). Decision record: chose SOPS over git-crypt (value-level encryption, CNCF backing, key rotation) and gocryptfs over VeraCrypt (no disk images to manage, CLI-native, overlay filesystem).

  - Notes: secretlint-helper.sh install puts packages in main repo node_modules/, but scan runs in CWD. In worktrees, node_modules/ doesn't exist so check_rules_installed() always fails. Fix: resolve main worktree path via `git worktree list --porcelain | head -1`, use `npm list --prefix <main_path>` as fallback, and make install worktree-aware (install to main repo or symlink).
- [x] t192 Supervisor evaluates successful workers as clean_exit_no_signal — misses PR URL from logs #bugfix #supervisor ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#719 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T03:38:15Z logged:2026-02-09 pr:750 verified:2026-02-09
  - Notes: Workers that create PRs and exit cleanly are evaluated as clean_exit_no_signal because the evaluation heuristic doesn't detect PR URLs from the worker's JSON log output. This causes unnecessary retries (observed for t191 and t134 in backlog-06). Fix: in evaluate_worker(), parse the worker log for gh pr create output or PR URLs before falling back to clean_exit_no_signal. The pr_url field should be populated from the log even when the worker doesn't explicitly signal completion.
- [x] t193 setup.sh fails in non-interactive supervisor deploy step #bugfix #setup ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#720 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-09T03:40:31Z logged:2026-02-09 pr:749 verified:2026-02-09
  - Notes: When supervisor runs setup.sh as a deploy step (pr-lifecycle deploying phase), it fails because setup.sh hits an interactive prompt for shell integration. The script needs a --non-interactive or --ci flag that skips interactive prompts and only copies agent files. Observed during t191 deploy — setup.sh output truncated at "Shell integration not detected" with non-zero exit.

    - Notes: EOA spam API: 3 test methods (eoa — content-only from EOA servers, smtp — via your SMTP relay, seed — send to seed addresses for real filter testing). Spam clients: b2b (corporate filters) + b2c (consumer filters). Results: per-filter pass/fail with details. mail-tester.com automation: Playwright to get test address, guide user to send, scrape score + recommendations. Seed list management: reserve via API (GET /v5/spam/seedlist), reuse keys across tests.

    - Notes: New checks to add (inspired by EOA but implemented locally): (1) Subject line analysis — length check (<50 chars for mobile), spam trigger word scan, emoji usage, personalization token detection. (2) HTML weight/size check — total email size, image-to-text ratio, HTML complexity score. (3) Unsubscribe header validation — List-Unsubscribe and List-Unsubscribe-Post headers present. (4) Plain text fallback — verify multipart/alternative with text/plain part. (5) Sender reputation lookup — integrate with existing blacklist check but add sender score services. (6) Domain age check — newly registered domains flag. (7) URL validation — check all links resolve, no redirects to suspicious domains, no URL shorteners in email body. (8) Image hosting validation — images hosted on reliable CDN, not local/temp URLs. Update email-health-check-helper.sh with new commands.

    - Notes: Unified accessibility testing agent covering web pages and email HTML. Tool decision tree: axe-core (free, open-source, de facto standard — inject via Playwright page.evaluate or @axe-core/cli) for automated WCAG 2.2 A/AA rule checking. WAVE API (paid, $0.025-0.04/credit, 100 free credits) for comprehensive analysis with XPath/CSS selectors for each issue. WebAIM Contrast Checker API (free, no key) for individual color pair validation. Lighthouse accessibility category (already installed via pagespeed-helper.sh) for scoring + audit results. Covers: color contrast (WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.3 AA 4.5:1 normal/3:1 large, SC 1.4.6 AAA 7:1/4.5:1, SC 1.4.11 non-text contrast 3:1), keyboard navigation, ARIA roles/labels, heading hierarchy, alt text, form labels, focus indicators, link purpose, language attributes, reading order, motion/animation preferences. Email-specific: table role=presentation, semantic headings in table cells, lang attribute on html element, link text quality (no "click here"), sufficient contrast in inline styles.

    - Notes: Commands: audit (full WCAG scan via axe-core on URL or local file), contrast (extract all fg/bg color pairs from computed styles via Playwright, check against WCAG AA/AAA thresholds), contrast-check (single color pair via WebAIM API — fcolor, bcolor, returns ratio + AA/AAA pass/fail), wave (submit URL to WAVE API, parse errors/contrast/alerts/features/structure/ARIA), lighthouse-a11y (run Lighthouse --only-categories=accessibility, parse individual audits), email-a11y (axe-core + email-specific rules on HTML file), report (generate WCAG compliance report — pass/fail per success criterion, grouped by principle). Config: WAVE API key via aidevops secret, output format (json/markdown/html), WCAG level target (A/AA/AAA, default AA).
  - [x] t215.3 Playwright contrast extraction — computed style analysis for all visible elements ~20m ref:GH#906 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T14:58:48Z completed:2026-02-10 pr:#937
    - Notes: Use Playwright page.evaluate() to traverse all visible DOM elements, extract computed foreground color (color) and background color (backgroundColor, walking up ancestors for transparent backgrounds), font size and weight (to determine "large text" threshold: >=18pt or >=14pt bold). Calculate contrast ratio per WCAG formula: (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05) where L = relative luminance. Flag failures at AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large) and AAA (7:1 normal, 4.5:1 large). Also check non-text contrast (SC 1.4.11) for UI components and graphical objects at 3:1. Handle edge cases: gradients (sample multiple points), background images (flag as manual review), opacity, CSS filters. Output: element selector, actual colors, computed ratio, threshold, pass/fail, WCAG criterion. Cross-validate individual pairs against WebAIM Contrast Checker API for accuracy.
  - [x] t215.4 WAVE API integration — comprehensive accessibility analysis ~15m ref:GH#907 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T15:00:07Z completed:2026-02-10 pr:#941
    - Notes: WAVE API at wave.webaim.org/api/. Auth: API key parameter. Endpoints: /request with url + key + reporttype (1=basic stats, 2=detailed with selectors, 3=page source annotated, 4=full). Credits: reporttype 1-2 cost 1 credit, 3 costs 2, 4 costs 3. Response JSON: categories (error, contrast, alert, feature, structure, aria) each with count + items array. Items include id (rule code), description, count, selectors (XPath + CSS). Map WAVE rule IDs to WCAG success criteria for compliance reporting. Cache results to avoid burning credits on repeated scans. Rate limit: respect API limits.
  - [x] t215.5 Enhance pagespeed.md — surface Lighthouse accessibility as first-class output ~15m ref:GH#908 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T15:11:39Z completed:2026-02-10 pr:#936
    - Notes: Currently pagespeed-helper.sh runs full Lighthouse but accessibility is buried in the overall report. Add: (1) accessibility command that runs --only-categories=accessibility and presents individual audit results (color-contrast, image-alt, label, heading-order, link-name, etc.) with element selectors and fix guidance. (2) Surface accessibility score prominently in the default report output. (3) Add --wcag-level flag to filter audits by WCAG level. (4) Cross-reference with axe-core results (Lighthouse uses axe-core internally but only a subset of rules).
  - [x] t215.6 Email accessibility checks — integrate into email-health-check + email-design-test ~15m ref:GH#909 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T15:12:44Z completed:2026-02-10 pr:#943
    - Notes: Add to email-health-check-helper.sh: (1) lang attribute on html element, (2) table role=presentation for layout tables, (3) alt text on all images (not just presence but quality — flag generic "image" or filename-based alt), (4) semantic heading hierarchy (h1-h6 not just font-size styling), (5) contrast ratio check on inline styles (parse style attributes for color/background-color pairs), (6) link text quality (flag "click here", "read more", "learn more" without context), (7) font size minimum (flag text below 14px). Add to email-design-test-helper.sh: run axe-core on rendered email HTML in Playwright, overlay contrast issues on screenshots. Reference WCAG 2.2 + Email Markup Consortium accessibility guidelines.

- [x] t216 Orphaned PR scanner — run eagerly after worker evaluation, not just Phase 6 throttled #bugfix #supervisor #self-improvement ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) ref:GH#911 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T04:36:28Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#917
  - Notes: Currently scan_orphaned_prs() only runs in Phase 6 of the pulse with a 10-minute throttle. Workers that create PRs but get evaluated as `task_only` (because the PR wasn't in the DB) must wait for the next throttle window. Fix: (1) After any worker evaluates as `complete (task_only)`, immediately check GitHub for open PRs on that task's branch (`feature/tXXX`) — this is a targeted single-PR lookup, not a full scan, so no throttle needed. (2) If found, link the PR and transition to `pr_review` instead of `deployed`. (3) Keep the full Phase 6 scan as a safety net for edge cases. This eliminates the gap where t204 created PR #886 but the supervisor marked it `deployed (task_only)`.

- [x] t217 Worker prompt — enforce Task tool parallelism for independent subtasks #enhancement #supervisor #efficiency ~1h (ai:45m test:15m) ref:GH#912 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T04:37:10Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#918
  - Notes: Workers currently receive a suggestion to use the Task tool for parallel sub-work (line 3649 of supervisor-helper.sh) but none actually do it — all 4 workers in backlog-12 executed sequentially. Strengthen the prompt: (1) Change from suggestion to explicit instruction with a concrete example. (2) Add a decision heuristic: "If your TodoWrite has 3+ subtasks and any two don't modify the same files, spawn the independent one via Task tool." (3) Add a worked example showing how to parallelise (e.g., writing tests in a sub-agent while implementing the main script). (4) Track whether workers actually use Task tool in evaluation — add a heuristic check for `mcp_task` calls in the log.

- [x] t218 Verification proof-logs — structured audit trail for task completion trust #enhancement #supervisor #verification ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) ref:GH#913 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T04:38:00Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#921
  - Notes: The verify stage (t180) runs check: directives from VERIFY.md but doesn't produce a structured proof-log that can be audited later. Without proof-logs, false completions (task_only, no_pr) are hard to diagnose and trust. Implement: (1) Create a `proof-log.json` per task in `$SUPERVISOR_DIR/proofs/tXXX.json` containing: task_id, pr_url, pr_merged_at, ci_checks (name+status), review_triage_result, verify_checks (each check: directive + pass/fail + output snippet), deploy_confirmed (setup.sh exit code), todo_updated_at. (2) The supervisor writes to this log at each lifecycle stage (pr_review, merging, deploying, verifying). (3) `update_todo_on_complete()` must refuse to mark `[x]` unless proof-log exists and all stages passed. (4) Add `supervisor-helper.sh proof <task_id>` command to display the proof-log for any task. (5) Add `supervisor-helper.sh audit [batch_id]` to summarise proof-logs for a batch — flag any tasks marked complete without full proof chain.

- [x] t219 PR lifecycle — faster merge pipeline with parallel CI + review triage #enhancement #supervisor #throughput ~1.5h (ai:1h test:30m) ref:GH#914 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-10T04:39:17Z logged:2026-02-10 completed:2026-02-10 pr:#922
  - Notes: The PR lifecycle (pr_review → review_triage → merging → merged → deploying → deployed) processes one stage per pulse (every 5 min). A PR with passing CI and no review threads takes 3+ pulses (15+ min) to go from complete to deployed. Improve: (1) Allow multi-stage transitions within a single pulse — if CI passes and no review threads, go straight from pr_review to merging in one pulse. (2) After merge, immediately run deploy + verify in the same pulse instead of waiting for the next one. (3) Add a fast-path: if the PR has all CI green and zero review comments at evaluation time, skip the pr_review wait and go directly to merging. (4) Log timing metrics per stage in the proof-log (t218) so we can measure pipeline latency and identify bottlenecks.

  - Notes: GCP SA auth (seo-utils@evergreen-je), all youtube-helper.sh commands tested live (channel, videos, video, competitors, quota). ShellCheck zero violations. Google OAuth2 JWT grant type discovery documented. PR #811 merged via squash.
- [x] t190 Fix Codacy MD022 violations in memory graduation output #bugfix #quality ~30m actual:15m assignee:alexey ref:GH#703 logged:2026-02-09 started:2026-02-09 completed:2026-02-09 verified:2026-02-09 PR #703 merged
  - Notes: memory-graduate-helper.sh generates markdown without blank lines before ### category headings (MD022). Root cause: bash `$(cat file)` strips trailing newlines. Fixed generator with first_category flag and corrected existing output.
- [x] t069 Fix toon-helper.sh validate command #bugfix ~15m actual:10m logged:2026-01-24 completed:2026-01-25
  - Notes: Fixed - validate command now correctly receives input_file via $arg2 from case statement. Verified code at lines 437-442 properly passes arguments.
- [x] t010 Evaluate Merging build-agent and build-mcp into aidevops #plan ~4h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: Decision: Keep as subagents in tools/ (not merge into aidevops.md). Implemented in v2.41.0 - generate-opencode-agents.sh cleans up old files, architecture.md documents the pattern.
- [x] t018 Enhance Plan+ and Build+ with OpenCode's Latest Features #plan ~3h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: All 4 phases complete. 1) Disabled built-in build/plan agents. 2) Set Plan+ as default_agent. 3) Added granular bash permissions for file discovery (git ls-files, fd, rg --files). 4) Updated generate-opencode-agents.sh. PR #123 merged.

  - Notes: SonarCloud quality gate was already OK. Fixed OpenCode Agent workflow failing on `pull_request_review_comment` events due to `context.payload.issue` being undefined. Now uses `context.payload.pull_request` as fallback and appropriate API methods for PR review comments. PR #121 merged.
