- [ ] t108 Dashboard token storage hardening (avoid localStorage; add reset/clear flow) #security #dashboard #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#2026-02-03-dashboard-token-storage-hardening] ~3h (ai:1.5h test:1h read:30m) logged:2026-02-03
- [x] t121 Fix template deploy head usage error (invalid option -z) #setup #deploy #bugfix ~30m actual:0m (ai:0m) logged:2026-02-03 completed:2026-02-06
  - Notes: Already fixed in PR #346. deploy-templates.sh replaced GNU-only `head -z` with macOS-compatible `while read -r` loop. No remaining `head -z` usage in codebase.
- [x] t122 Resolve awk newline warnings during setup deploy (system-reminder) #setup #deploy #bugfix ~45m actual:15m (ai:15m) logged:2026-02-03 completed:2026-02-06
  - Notes: Replaced `awk -v` with while-read loops in aidevops.sh cmd_upgrade_planning() to fix BSD awk "newline in string" warnings when passing multi-line shell variables. PR #371 merged.
- [x] t123 Resolve DSPy dependency conflict (gepa) in setup flow #python #dspy #deps ~45m actual:0m (ai:0m test:0m) logged:2026-02-03 completed:2026-02-06
  - Notes: Already resolved. dspy 3.1.3 pulls gepa 0.0.26 as transitive dep with no conflicts. Fresh venv install of requirements.txt succeeds, pip check passes, both dspy and gepa import cleanly. Original conflict was likely version-specific and no longer reproduces.
- [x] t082 Fix version sync inconsistency (VERSION vs package.json/setup.sh/aidevops.sh) #bugfix ~15m actual:0m (ai:10m test:5m) logged:2026-01-29 completed:2026-02-06
  - Notes: Already fixed. All version files (VERSION, package.json, sonar-project.properties, .claude-plugin/marketplace.json) are in sync at 2.101.0. setup.sh and aidevops.sh read VERSION dynamically (no hardcoded version). version-manager.sh validate confirms consistency. Original issue from bd0695c was resolved by subsequent releases using version-manager.sh.

  - Notes: Review complete. See todo/research/pi-agent-review.md. Key findings: Pi's minimal 4-tool core validates aidevops's on-demand MCP loading. Session trees (branching/rewinding) are the most interesting feature aidevops lacks but can't implement without agent-level support. Extension hot-reload is powerful but different architecture from aidevops's markdown subagents. Recommended: document "remix" skill pattern in build-agent.md, add desktop notification pattern for long tasks. Skip: removing MCP, rewriting in TypeScript.

  - Notes: Tirith (1,300 stars, Rust, AGPL-3.0) - also see t104 plan: Tirith's `tirith run` command provides verified download-then-execute as the implementation vehicle for curl|sh hardening. - terminal security tool that catches attacks browsers block but terminals don't. **30 rules across 7 categories:** 1) Homograph attacks (Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes, punycode, mixed-script). 2) Terminal injection (ANSI escapes, bidi overrides, zero-width chars). 3) Pipe-to-shell (`curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `eval $(wget ...)`). 4) Dotfile attacks (downloads targeting ~/.bashrc, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). 5) Insecure transport (HTTP piped to shell, `curl -k`). 6) Ecosystem threats (git clone typosquats, untrusted Docker registries, pip/npm URL installs). 7) Credential exposure (userinfo tricks, shortened URLs). **Integration options:** 1) Add to aidevops setup/onboarding as recommended install. 2) Create tirith.md subagent at tools/security/. 3) Document shell hook setup (`eval "$(tirith init)"`). 4) Consider MCP wrapper for `tirith check` command validation. **Key features:** Sub-millisecond overhead, local-only (no network calls), YAML policy config, bypass with `TIRITH=0` prefix. Install: `brew install sheeki03/tap/tirith` or `npm install -g tirith` or `cargo install tirith`.

  - Notes: Set up and test Pipecat AI framework with multiple S2S providers for building realtime voice agents. **Cloud S2S providers:** GPT-4o-Realtime (OpenAI, most mature Pipecat S2S), AWS Nova Sonic, Gemini Multimodal Live, Ultravox. **NVIDIA Nemotron:** Cloud-only via NVIDIA API (requires NVIDIA GPU for local; use free cloud credits for low usage). **Local S2S:** MiniCPM-o 4.5 (23k stars, Apache-2.0, 9B params) - runs on Mac via llama.cpp-omni, full-duplex voice+vision+text, WebRTC demo available. Also MiniCPM-o 2.6 for lighter use. Two use cases: 1) Integrate with OpenClaw (t046) for realtime voice calls via WhatsApp/Telegram/phone. 2) Customer service voice agents with Daily.co WebRTC transport. Steps: configure GPT-4o-Realtime S2S first, test MiniCPM-o local pipeline on Mac, test Nemotron via NVIDIA cloud API, integrate with OpenClaw gateway, build customer service agent template with configurable personas.

- [x] t069 Fix toon-helper.sh validate command #bugfix ~15m actual:10m logged:2026-01-24 completed:2026-01-25
  - Notes: Fixed - validate command now correctly receives input_file via $arg2 from case statement. Verified code at lines 437-442 properly passes arguments.
- [x] t010 Evaluate Merging build-agent and build-mcp into aidevops #plan ~4h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: Decision: Keep as subagents in tools/ (not merge into aidevops.md). Implemented in v2.41.0 - generate-opencode-agents.sh cleans up old files, architecture.md documents the pattern.
- [x] t018 Enhance Plan+ and Build+ with OpenCode's Latest Features #plan ~3h actual:1h logged:2025-12-21 completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: All 4 phases complete. 1) Disabled built-in build/plan agents. 2) Set Plan+ as default_agent. 3) Added granular bash permissions for file discovery (git ls-files, fd, rg --files). 4) Updated generate-opencode-agents.sh. PR #123 merged.
- [x] t065 Fix postflight warnings: SonarCloud critical issues + OpenCode Agent workflow #bugfix #quality ~2h actual:30m logged:2026-01-17 started:2026-01-18T18:00Z completed:2026-01-18
  - Notes: SonarCloud quality gate was already OK. Fixed OpenCode Agent workflow failing on `pull_request_review_comment` events due to `context.payload.issue` being undefined. Now uses `context.payload.pull_request` as fallback and appropriate API methods for PR review comments. PR #121 merged.
- [x] t001 Add TODO.md and planning workflow #workflow ~2h actual:1.5h logged:2025-12-18 completed:2025-12-20

- [x] t003 Add oh-my-opencode integration #tools ~30m actual:25m logged:2025-12-18 completed:2025-12-18
- [x] t011 Demote wordpress.md from main agent to subagent #architecture ~1h actual:45m logged:2025-12-21 started:2025-12-22T04:10Z completed:2025-12-22
- [x] t022 Move wordpress from root to tools/wordpress #refactor ~30m actual:25m logged:2025-12-22 started:2025-12-22T05:15Z completed:2025-12-22
- [x] t019 Beads Integration for aidevops #plan #beads ~2d actual:1.5d logged:2025-12-21 started:2025-12-21T16:00Z completed:2025-12-22
