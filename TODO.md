  - Notes: Camoufox (4.6k stars) - FOSS Firefox anti-detect with Playwright, fingerprint rotation, WebRTC spoofing, passes DataDome/Cloudflare/Imperva. See also: https://github.com/TheGP/untidetect-tools (comprehensive list). Needs residential proxy integration for multi-account (DataImpulse $1/GB, WebShare $6/GB).
- [ ] t040 Add Reddit CLI/API integration for reading and posting #tools #social-media ~4h (ai:2h test:1h read:1h) logged:2025-01-05 ref:https://github.com/praw-dev/praw
  - Notes: PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) 4k stars. JSON endpoints (.json suffix) still work but rate-limited: 96 calls/10min unauthenticated (per IP), 996/10min authenticated (per account). CORS now enforced so web frontends blocked. For heavy scraping: use OAuth + rotating residential proxies, or anti-detect browser with account rotation.
- [ ] t041 Document curl-copy authenticated scraping workflow #tools #browser #scraping ~1h (ai:30m test:15m read:15m) logged:2025-01-05
  - Notes: Quick method for scraping authenticated pages: DevTools → Network → Copy as cURL → paste to Claude. Copies session cookies with request. Works on dashboards, gated content, private APIs. Caveat: tokens expire, need to recopy for short sessions. Add to tools/browser/ or workflows/.

  - Notes: Official Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) for cloud Bitwarden accounts. Separate from Vaultwarden (self-hosted). Commands: login, unlock, list, get, create, edit, delete, generate, export, import. Install: `npm install -g @bitwarden/cli`. Add to tools/credentials/bitwarden.md.
- [ ] t044 Enhance Vaultwarden agent with bitwarden-cli MCP integration #tools #credentials #security ~2h (ai:1h test:30m read:30m) logged:2025-01-08
  - Notes: Existing vaultwarden.md uses Bitwarden CLI but could be enhanced with official bitwarden-cli MCP server. Review https://github.com/bitwarden/cli for latest features. Consider bitwarden-sdk-server for programmatic access.
- [ ] t045 Create Enpass agent using enpass-cli #tools #credentials #security ~4h (ai:2h test:1h read:1h) logged:2025-01-08
  - Notes: Use https://github.com/hazcod/enpass-cli (156 stars, Go). BLOCKER: Issue #151 - SQLCipher v4 incompatibility with Enpass v6.8+. May need to fork and PR fix for SQLCipher v4 support. Install: `brew install enpass-cli` or `go install github.com/hazcod/enpass-cli@latest`. Commands: list, show, copy, pass. Add to tools/credentials/enpass.md.
- [ ] t046 Review Clawdbot for inspiration and incorporation into aidevops #research #agents #messaging ~4h (ai:2h test:1h read:1h) logged:2025-01-09 ref:https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot

Key features to evaluate: Gateway WS control plane, multi-agent routing, Voice Wake + Talk Mode, Live Canvas with A2UI, skills platform, Docker sandboxing for non-main sessions. Could inspire: messaging integrations for aidevops, voice control, canvas UI, agent-to-agent communication (sessions_* tools). MIT licensed.
- [ ] t047 TODO/PLANS sync with GitHub/GitLab/Gitea issues + cross-platform tools research #git #sync #planning ~4h (ai:2h test:1h read:1h) logged:2025-01-09
  - Notes: Evaluate bi-directional sync between TODO.md/PLANS.md and git platform issues. Research tools for syncing issues/PRs across multiple git platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea). Related to t020 (Git Issues Bi-directional Sync). Consider: gitea-github-migrator, gitlab-github-sync, issue-sync tools, Allspice Hub, Linear/Jira integrations. Key questions: 1) Should tasks auto-create issues? 2) Should issue updates sync back to TODO.md? 3) How to handle cross-platform mirroring for multi-platform projects?
- [ ] t048 Add worktree cleanup reminder to postflight workflow #workflow #git ~30m (ai:15m test:10m read:5m) logged:2025-01-10
  - Notes: After PR merge, postflight.md should remind to clean up worktrees for merged branches. Add section with `worktree-helper.sh list` and `worktree-helper.sh clean` commands.
- [ ] t049 Add timing analysis commands to ralph-loop workflow #workflow #automation ~30m (ai:15m test:10m read:5m) logged:2025-01-10
  - Notes: Document how to analyze CI timing data for adaptive wait optimization. Include commands for extracting timing from GitHub Actions logs and updating shared-constants.sh.
- [ ] t050 Move SonarCloud hotspot patterns from AGENTS.md to code-review subagent #refactor #docs ~30m (ai:15m test:10m read:5m) logged:2025-01-11
  - Notes: AGENTS.md lines 85-89 contain SonarCloud hotspot patterns (S5332, S6506 exclusions). Move to tools/code-review/ subagent to reduce root AGENTS.md size. Low priority - patterns work fine where they are.
- [x] t059 Review and merge unmerged feature branches #git #cleanup ~1h (ai:30m test:15m read:15m) logged:2026-01-11 started:2026-01-11T05:25Z completed:2026-01-11 actual:45m
  - Notes: Processed all 13 branches. PRs merged: #44, #46, #48, #51. PRs closed (already in main): #45, #47, #49, #50. Branches deleted (superseded): feature/beads-integration, feature/domain-research-subagent, feature/loop-system-v2, feature/memory-auto-capture, feature/session-review-command. All remote branches cleaned up.
- [ ] t052 Agent Design Pattern Improvements #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#agent-design-pattern-improvements] ~1d (ai:6h test:4h read:2h) logged:2025-01-11
  - Notes: Implement remaining improvements from Lance Martin's agent design patterns analysis. Includes: YAML frontmatter for subagents, automatic session reflection, cache-aware prompts, tool description indexing, memory consolidation.
- [ ] t053 Add YAML frontmatter to source subagents #architecture #agents ~2h (ai:1.5h test:30m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052
  - Notes: Add description, triggers, tools fields to all .agent/**/*.md files. Update generate-opencode-agents.sh to parse frontmatter for better progressive disclosure.
- [ ] t054 Automatic session reflection to memory #workflow #memory ~4h (ai:2.5h test:1h read:30m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052
  - Notes: Create session-distill-helper.sh to extract learnings. Integrate with /session-review. Auto-call /remember with distilled insights.
- [ ] t055 Document cache-aware prompt patterns #docs #optimization ~1h (ai:30m test:15m read:15m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052
  - Notes: Add guidance to build-agent.md for stable-prefix patterns and avoiding instruction reordering for better prompt cache hits.
- [ ] t056 Tool description indexing for on-demand MCP discovery #tools #context ~3h (ai:2h test:45m read:15m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052
  - Notes: Cursor-style MCP description sync to .agent-workspace/mcp-descriptions/. Add search tool for on-demand discovery instead of loading all tool definitions upfront.
- [ ] t057 Memory consolidation and pruning #memory #optimization ~2h (ai:1h test:45m read:15m) logged:2025-01-11 blocked-by:t052
  - Notes: Add memory-helper.sh consolidate command. Periodic reflection to merge similar memories and prune stale/superseded entries.
- [ ] t058 Memory Auto-Capture #plan → [todo/PLANS.md#memory-auto-capture] ~1d (ai:6h test:4h read:2h) logged:2026-01-11
  - Notes: Automatic memory capture inspired by claude-mem but tool-agnostic. Agent instructions trigger capture after significant operations. Works with OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf. PRD: todo/tasks/prd-memory-auto-capture.md
- [ ] t060 Research jj (Jujutsu) VCS for aidevops advantages #research #git #tools ~2h (ai:1h read:1h) logged:2026-01-13 ref:https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj
  - Notes: Git-compatible VCS (24.7k stars) with unique features: working-copy-as-commit (no staging area), operation log with undo, conflicts as first-class objects, automatic rebase of descendants, anonymous branches. Could simplify worktree workflows, enable safer experimentation, and provide better conflict handling. Evaluate: 1) Integration with existing git workflows 2) Colocated mode compatibility 3) Benefits for AI-assisted development 4) Learning curve vs productivity gains.
- [ ] t061 Create debug-opengraph and debug-favicon subagents #tools #seo #browser ~3h (ai:2h test:30m read:30m) logged:2026-01-14 ref:https://opengraphdebug.com/
  - Notes: Inspired by opengraphdebug.com. Two subagents: 1) debug-opengraph.md - validate Open Graph meta tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, twitter:card), preview social sharing appearance, check image dimensions/accessibility. 2) debug-favicon.md - validate favicon setup across platforms (favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon, manifest icons), check sizes/formats, verify PWA manifest. Could use browser automation (Stagehand/Playwright) or direct HTML parsing. Add to tools/seo/ or tools/browser/.
- [ ] t062 Research vercel-labs/agent-skills for inclusion in aidevops #research #tools #deployment ~2h (ai:1h read:1h) logged:2026-01-14 ref:https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills
  - Notes: Vercel's Agent Skills collection (332 stars, MIT). Currently includes vercel-deploy skill for instant deployment without auth. Auto-detects 40+ frameworks, returns preview URL + claim URL. Follows agentskills.io format (SKILL.md structure). Evaluate: 1) Add vercel-deploy as aidevops skill 2) Adopt Agent Skills format for aidevops skills 3) Contribute aidevops skills back to ecosystem.
- [ ] t063 Fix secretlint scanning performance #bugfix #secretlint #performance ~30m (ai:15m test:10m read:5m) logged:2026-01-14
  - Notes: Secretlint scans 19,790 files (572MB) including python-env binaries, causing 60+ min hangs. Fix: 1) Add missing patterns to .secretlintignore (python-env, .osgrep, .scannerwork) - must mirror .gitignore to avoid security gaps. 2) Add --init flag to docker run for proper timeout handling. 3) Increase timeout from 30s to 60s. Result: Scans ~230 files in seconds, timeout now properly stops container. Principle: .secretlintignore must be subset of .gitignore.
