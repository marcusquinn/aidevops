# ShellCheck configuration for aidevops
# Resolves SC1091 ("Not following: ... was not specified as input") by telling
# ShellCheck to look in the same directory as the script being checked.
# This handles source "./shared-constants.sh" and source "./_common.sh" patterns.
source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# Project-wide accepted patterns and false positives:
#
# Library/sourced-file architecture:
# SC2329: "Function is never invoked" — false positive for library functions
#         called indirectly via source or test runners
# SC2317: "Command appears unreachable" — false positive for library functions
#         and return/exit guard patterns
# SC2034: "Variable appears unused" — false positive for variables set in
#         sourced files and used by the sourcing script
#
# Intentional coding patterns:
# SC2001: "See if you can use ${var//search/replace}" — sed is preferred for
#         complex patterns and multi-character replacements
# SC2059: "Don't use variables in printf format" — intentional for dynamic
#         format strings in helper scripts
# SC2012: "Use find instead of ls" — ls is intentional for simple listings
#         where non-alphanumeric filenames are not expected
# SC2030/SC2031: "PATH modified in subshell" — intentional for isolated
#         environment setup in subshells
# SC2015: "A && B || C is not if-then-else" — intentional pattern where
#         C is a safe fallback (logging, default value)
# SC2129: "Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file" — style preference
# SC2153: "Possible misspelling" — false positive for UPPER/lower conventions
# SC2004: "$/${} unnecessary on arithmetic variables" — style preference
# SC2009: "Consider using pgrep" — ps|grep is intentional for portability
