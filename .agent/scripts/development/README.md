# Development Scripts

This directory contains temporary development scripts that were used during the quality improvement process. These scripts are kept for reference and potential future use.

## 📜 **Script History:**

### **Quality Fix Scripts (November 2025)**
These scripts were created during the massive quality improvement initiative that resolved 197+ maintainability issues:

- **`comprehensive-quality-fix.sh`** - Early comprehensive fix attempt
- **`efficient-return-fix.sh`** - Efficient return statement fixes
- **`fix-misplaced-returns.sh`** - Targeted misplaced return fixes
- **`fix-return-statements.sh`** - General return statement fixes
- **`mass-fix-returns.sh`** - Mass return statement fixes

### **Development Context:**
These scripts were part of the systematic approach to achieve:
- 56.4% reduction in maintainability issues (349 → 152 issues)
- 31.7% reduction in technical debt (805 → 550 minutes)
- A- grade quality rating across SonarCloud, CodeFactor, and Codacy

### **Superseded By:**
The functionality of these scripts has been superseded by:
- **`../quality-fix.sh`** - Universal automated quality fixes
- **`../quality-check.sh`** - Multi-platform quality validation
- **`../pre-commit-hook.sh`** - Continuous quality assurance

## 🔧 **Usage Note:**
These scripts are kept for historical reference and should not be used in production. Use the current quality automation tools in the parent `scripts/` directory instead.

## 🗑️ **Future Cleanup:**
These files may be removed in future versions once the quality improvement methodology is fully documented and stable.
