Dear Jane,

I wanted to follow up on our meeting at the London office on 15 January 2026.

As discussed, the property at 42 Baker Street has been valued by Acme Corp at
GBP 1.2 million. The survey was conducted by David Williams from Knight Frank
on 10/01/2026.

Please forward this to Sarah Johnson at Barclays and Michael Chen at
PricewaterhouseCoopers for their review before the board meeting on
February 28, 2026.

The Manchester branch office valuation is still pending — we expect results
by March 15, 2026.

Best regards,
John Smith
Senior Partner
Acme Corp
