# PR Task ID Check - Implementation Notes

## File: .github/workflows/pr-task-id-check.yml

This workflow enforces that every PR references a valid task ID from TODO.md.
The implementation is complete in the local worktree but requires manual push
due to GitHub OAuth token scope limitations.

See PR body for push instructions.

This file can be deleted after the workflow file is pushed.
